How do protected areas in Central African countries contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity?,"['40\nVarious COMIFAC directives, notably those on \nenvironmental and social impact studies in forest \nareas, and on the participation of local and indig-\nenous populations and NGOs in the sustainable \nmanagement of Central African forests, also apply to \nprotected areas.

This indicates that coordination \nbetween the various government services involved can \nremain tricky. Despite this, protected areas are grad-\nually becoming the subject of a coordinated approach \namong government departments and local authorities, \nrather than being seen as a sectoral issue.

Although the forest (in some regions) and large \nfauna (in general) are under significant pressure, the \necological frameworks (forests and savannas, aquatic \necosystems, etc.) often remain, allowing biodiversity \nto be dispersed (see section 2). \nIn fact, the question that arises is not so much the \nsize of the protected area network as the effective -\nness of its management. Although a comprehensive \nassessment of this issue is warranted, it is beyond the \nscope of this document.

However, \nthis protection varies greatly depending on the species \nor subspecies under consideration. For example, only 15% of the range of the Central African chimpanzee \nand the western lowland gorilla is officially protected \n(Figure 8 and Table 6). These species are still fairly \nwidespread, but are under severe pressure and their \nprotection needs to be improved. \nIn contrast, over 98% of the mountain goril-\nla’s range is protected.

They \nare not protected areas, but they can contribute to \nmaintaining functional ecosystems and play a role \nin the connectivity of protected areas. In terms of \nmaintaining the living fabric of our planet, manage -\nment status alone is not the only important factor, \nbut also the proximity of human settlements and \neffective territorial\xa0management.\n2. Protection of biodiversity\n2.1. A diversity of biomes\nCentral Africa extends from the Sahara Desert to \nthe Congolese rainforests and Zambezi open forests \n(miombo), and from coastal mangrove forests to the \nmountain forests of the Albertine Rift (Table 4 and \nFigure 6). It is crossed by a climatic gradient charac -\nterized by mean annual rainfall ranging from 250 mm \nto 10,000 mm (Doumenge et al., 2015a). Although \nthe aquatic biomes also are very diverse (freshwater \nand marine biomes), the following section focuses \non the protection of terrestrial ones.Only 17% of the total area of these terrestrial \nbiomes is protected, either under national status or \nas a result of international recognition (Table 4). This \naverage masks highly variable degrees of protection; \nwithout going into detail here, some small biomes, \nsuch as mangroves and low mountain vegetation, are \nrelatively well protected, while others, for example, \narid zones and flooded savannas, are not. \nMangroves contribute to the protection of \ncoastlines, notably by reducing marine erosion and \nby participating in the cycle of nutrients in coastal \nenvironments. They host many spawning grounds \nrequired for productive and sustainable fisheries. \nIn addition, they produce basic goods for commu -\nnities living in their vicinity (harvesting bivalve \nmolluscs, firewood, salt, etc.). However, they are \nunder pressure due to infrastructure development \nfor industrial needs and coastal urbanization, \nover exploitation of fuelwood and colonization by \ninvasive species (FAO, 2017).\nAlthough the legal and institutional frameworks \nfor mangrove management and exploitation remain \ninsufficient for their protection in Central African \ncountries, Cameroon hopes that all mangroves will \nhave conservation status by 2025 (Nchoutpouen \net al., 2017).

How do forest concessions in the DRC help biodiversity and how does legislation impact their management?,"['28\nforest cover for the conservation of fragile soils, \nsprings or watercourses and sacred forests”, as well as \nnatural conservation forests, with the “main purpose \nof ensuring the sustainability of forest species, the \nprotection of the habitat of fauna and flora or the \npreservation of landscapes” (Congo, 2020). In DRC, \nthe status conservation forestry concession has been \nestablished, in particular to meet certain expectations \nrelated to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation \nand Forest Degradation (REDD+; see section 4).\nProvisions also exist for the creation of community \nforests, or even for the creation of local community \nforestry concessions (in DRC; Vermeulen & Karsenty, \n2015). The main objective of these provisions is to \nenable rural communities to secure control over forest \nareas for their own benefit, in theory in a sustainable \nmanner. However, some of these provisions are being \nused by rural communities to create conservation areas \nwithout jumping through the hoops of protected area \nmanagement agencies. This is the case in DRC with \nthe association Mbou Mon Tour, which has led the \nproject to create the Mbali River community forestry \nconcession (bringing together six villages), intended \nfor the conservation of bonobos and their habitat \n(see Chapter 2). This example is not an isolated case \nand could, in the long run, lead to a set of territories \nwith a primary conservation vocation, which would \n complement the “classic” network of protected areas.These different examples show that from different \npieces of legislation (forestry laws, wildlife and \nconservation laws), it is possible to set up spaces for \nbiodiversity conservation (see also Doumenge et al., \n2015b). However, all of these elements raise the \nquestion of the effectiveness of the management of \nthese territories with regard to conservation objec -\ntives and the application of laws (Wabiwa Betoko & \nde Hoog, 2021). Another question mentioned earlier \nconcerns the harmonization of approaches and desig -\nnations between countries. A shared, expanded and \n harmonized frame of reference would be desirable.\nHowever, the efforts made to increase the \nnumber of protected areas should not absolve the \nStates of their environmental responsibilities outside \nprotected areas, meaning in 70 to 83% of the terri -\ntories, depending on the objectives set. The question \nis no longer to pit strong protection zones against \nweak protection zones (Denhez, 2020), but to \ndevelop territorial projects where hotspots of high \nbiodiversity value are connected through a network \nof ecological corridors supporting socio-economic \nactivities that respect the environment.\nOverall, there is an urgent need to consider \nother concepts, such as IUCN’s Other Effective \narea-based Conservation Measures (OECM). \nBiodiversity conservation strategies cannot stop \nat the borders of protected areas. They must cover \n', '38\n3. Continually evolving legislation \nGovernments have a range of tools at their disposal \nto combat biodiversity loss. All Central African coun-\ntries have ratified various international agreements \nand conventions that provide a general framework \nfor actions and policies promoting better coexistence \nbetween humanity and the rest of the living world. \nHowever, it is national legislation that has the force \nof law above all else. Moreover, to be effective, such \nlegislation must be enforced by all stakeholders, not \njust protected area managers.\nSince 2015 and the first State of Protected Areas \n(Doumenge et al., 2015a), a number of new pieces \nof legislation have been enacted or revised. This \nis the case, for example, of the law of 8 July 2020 \nconcerning the forestry code in Congo, which intro -\nduced the notion of “ecological damage” that the \nState is likely to suffer as a result of actions against \nforest ecosystems. One of the changes observed in \nforest management also concerns conservation forest \nconcessions, which DRC has set up (see box). This \ntype of concession can complement the network of \nprotected areas in the subregion (see section 1.3), \nprovided that the laws and regulations are respected \nand that the objectives and management of these \nconcessions allow for effective biodiversity  protection (which may not always be the case; Wabiwa Betoko \n& de Hoog, 2021). However, this offers new opportu -\nnities for biodiversity protection and raises questions \nabout the inclusion of this type of land use in the \nglobal database of protected areas.\nThe level of protection provided for in the texts \nvaries greatly according to the type of ecosystems and \nthreats identified on the wild fauna and flora. Since \n2017, a decree designates ICCN as the manage-\nment body of the Convention on International Trade \nin Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora \n(CITES) in DRC. This facilitated the development \nof a National Ivory Action Plan (NIAP) 2016-2017, \nwith a focus on protecting elephants, which are \nsubject to intensive poaching both in the country and \nin neighboring countries that serve as a platform for \nthe sale or resale of ivory (Nkoke, 2017).\nNevertheless, while these texts are relatively effec-\ntive in sustainably preserving wild flora and fauna, \nincluding the natural habitats on which they depend, \nthey suffer from some imperfections that are ampli-\nfied by corruption, poverty and other socio-cultural \nobstacles. In the event of threats or serious damage \nto biodiversity, the creation of a protection tool and \nits implementation thus generally remain the sole \nresponsibility of the government; other stakeholders \nare at best consulted and rarely involved. \nConservation forest concessions  \nBiodiversity management in forest concessions has undergone significant changes since the \n1990s. In addition to the conservation zones allowed in Forest Management Units (FMUs), as \nestablished in most forestry codes (protection or conservation series), another category of \nforestry concession is gradually emerging: the conservation forest concession. \nThis type of concession was established in DRC by Decree No. 011/27 of 20 May 2011, which \nset out the specific rules of attribution. This innovative text allows any person who meets the \nrequirements to obtain the right to use the forest by valorizing its environmental services \n(such as REDD+ projects), excluding any extractive exploitation of its resources and without \nprejudice to the exercise of forest use rights by local populations and the initial or desired \necological balance of the forest. \nThis category of forest concession provides a complementary tool to protected areas, which \ncan be used to develop a “soft” approach to protect and value biodiversity. It would be \ninteresting if it were explicitly enshrined in the laws of other countries so that certain forest \nconcessions, initially allocated for industrial exploitation, could be converted into conservation \nconcessions with, at the core, a REDD+ style project. ']","Forest concessions in the DRC help biodiversity by providing a complementary tool to protected areas for protecting and valuing biodiversity.

This summary report \nwas prepared by the Central African Forest Obser-\nvatory (OFAC), under the auspices of the Central \nAfrican Forests Commission (COMIFAC). The \npreparation of SOPA 2015 was funded by the Euro-\npean Union through the RIOFAC project and the \n BIOPAMA-IUCN program, the Network of Central \nAfrican Protected Areas (RAPAC) through the \nOBAPAC project (Observatory of Biodiversity and \nProtected Areas of Central Africa), and the German \nAgency for International Cooperation through the \nGIZ COMIFAC support project.\xa0 Produced by a \nmultinational group of Central African protected \narea experts, SOPA 2015 focused on presenting each \ncountry’s protected area network, both with regard to \nthe types of protected areas as well as their size and \ndistribution. This was complemented by summary \nanalyses of various themes (legislation, institutions, \ngovernance, support projects, socio-economic issues). \nFollowing the success of SOPA 2015, many \ninstitutions voiced a desire to improve and rapidly \nupdate this publication. The momentum created by \nthe production of the first edition led to the devel -\nopment of the second, which explores in more detail \nvarious themes related to biodiversity conservation \nand protected area governance and management. \nSOPA 2020, the volume you are now holding in your \nhands, completes and updates the inventory of the \nsubregion’s protected area networks, but also breaks \nnew ground by delving deeply into certain themes \nthat were either only briefly discussed (governance, \ntourism, etc.) or not mentioned at all (human-  \nelephant conflicts, mining and oil industry, etc.) in \nthe first volume. These themes were discussed and approved in 2018 during a meeting of protected area \nspecialists held in Douala.\nThe objective of SOPA 2020 is to contribute \nto a more effective use of approaches and tools for \ncollecting and analysing data on protected area \nmanagement in Central Africa. It aims to provide an \noverview of their importance with regard to global \nchanges, but also to situate protected areas within \nnational and regional territories.

And \nhow are protected area managers in the subregion \nresponding to some of the challenges facing them? \nThis Chapter attempts to answer this twofold ques-\ntion; other more detailed answers also are provided in \nthe thematic chapters of this book.  \n1. Central African protected \nareas in 2020\n1.1 Nationally classified protected areas \nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature \n(IUCN) defines a protected area as “a clearly defined \ngeographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, \nthrough legal or other effective means, to ensure the \nlong-term conservation of nature and its associated \necosystem services and cultural values” (Dudley, 2008). \nThis definition covers a wide range of territories and \nencompasses diverse management statuses and types, \ngrouped into six categories (Figure 1). It also includes \na wide range of governance forms which are presented \nand discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. \n']","Central African protected areas contribute to global biodiversity protection and ecological balance by being part of the backbone of policies and strategies for biodiversity conservation and sustainable management. The increase in protected areas has helped mitigate the effects of climate change and species extinction. Protected area managers in the subregion are responding to challenges by implementing measures outlined in the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and negotiating the new post-2020 global biodiversity framework at the 15th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15-CBD). One key measure is to protect at least 30% of the world's land and marine areas, with at least 10% under strict protection.",multi_context,"[{'source': '../pdf/EdAP 2020_EN.pdf', 'page': 20, 'filename': '../pdf/EdAP 2020_EN.pdf'}]",True,"Central African protected areas support global biodiversity and ecological balance by serving as effective management tools to slow biodiversity loss, mitigate climate change impacts, and help ecosystems and communities adapt to change. Protected area managers in the region are addressing challenges by developing land-use plans that include national protected area networks and promoting the meaningful participation of local communities and indigenous peoples in management.
