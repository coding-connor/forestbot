The subregion has not been spared from \\\\nglobal warming.

Palla, L. Itsoua-Madzous &amp;amp; C. Doumenge\\\\nPlanning and managing protected areas require \\\\nknowledge about the status of these areas and the \\\\nissues affecting them. In 2015, the first edition of the \\\\nState of Protected Areas in Central Africa (SOPA-\\\\nCA) provided an up-to-date assessment of national \\\\nand subregional networks. This summary report \\\\nwas prepared by the Central African Forest Obser-\\\\nvatory (OFAC), under the auspices of the Central \\\\nAfrican Forests Commission (COMIFAC). The \\\\n...&quot;,&quot;This was complemented by summary \\\\nanalyses of various themes (legislation, institutions, \\\\ngovernance, support projects, socio-economic issues). \\\\nFollowing the success of SOPA 2015, many \\\\ninstitutions voiced a desire to improve and rapidly \\\\nupdate this publication. The momentum created by \\\\nthe production of the first edition led to the devel-\\\\nopment of the second, which explores in more detail \\\\nvarious themes related to biodiversity conservation \\\\nand protected area governance and management. \\\\nSOP...&quot;,&quot;In keeping with the \\\\nperspective of sustainable development in Central \\\\nAfrica, this geographical placement also must include \\\\nthe communities living in these territories. It is this \\\\nmuch needed dual integration of protected areas that \\\\nhas guided the authors throughout the book.\\\\nThis document is intended to be used by admin-\\\\nistrations in charge of protected areas, policy makers, \\\\ntechnical and financial partners, research institutions, \\\\nCivil Society Organizations (CSOs) and anyone else \\\\ninte...&quot;,&quot;15\\\\na general overview of protected area governance \\\\n(Chapter\\\\u202f2) which is complemented by a specific \\\\nchapter (Chapter\\\\u202f3) on Public-Private Partnerships \\\\n(PPP).

Tourism in Rwanda is anchored in the \\\\nnational parks, particularly mountain gorilla tourism. \\\\nThe current success also is du...&quot;,&quot;Despite this, the weakness of \\\\nthe infrastructure, the lack of policies and strategies \\\\nand the lack of an attractive legislative framework for \\\\ntourism operators remain handicaps. In general, the \\\\npolitical and institutional context is not yet conducive \\\\nto the development of ecotourism. \\\\n2.

In contrast, gorilla tourism \\\\nis well established in the Albertine Rift mountains, \\\\ngenerating significant income; western gorilla tourism \\\\nis more recent. In addition to these sites where great \\\\napes can be tracked in their natural environment, \\\\nseveral initiatives have been developed in the subre-\\\\ngion to host animals that have been poached, which \\\\nalso allow them to be seen in parks or in semi-liberty. \\\\nThese includ...&quot;,&quot;While eastern gorilla tourism is well established, \\\\nwestern lowland gorilla tourism could also act as a cata-\\\\nlyst for the tourism sector in Central Africa, although \\\\ndeveloping lowland gorilla tourism is somewhat more \\\\nchallenging (see box on this subject). Gorillas accus-\\\\ntomed to human presence can play an important role \\\\nas ambassadors for conservation (Greer &amp;amp; Cipolletta, \\\\n2006).

Lowland gorilla \\\\ntourism with habituated groups has proven to be challenging and expensive.

In villages such as \\\\nAndirni, guiding tourists was the main source of income, resulting in a strong spirit of conser-\\\\nvation that promotes the protection of the park to this day (Scholte, 2005). However, with the \\\\ndecline in tourism, conservation also has been affected.

Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Protected areas play a major role in both adaptation and mitigation of climate change by promoting long-term carbon storage and increasing carbon stocks. The Global Climate Fund in Central Africa supports clean energy production projects and land-use planning and reforestation projects to fight climate change. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;The objectives of the SAPA tool are to assess the positive and negative social impacts of protected areas on communities and to help managers increase social benefits and reduce negative impacts. The objectives of the SAGE tool are to assess governance and equity in conservation efforts at the site level and generate information for higher-level actors to improve management and produce national reports. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Luizza M.&amp;#x27;s 2017 report focuses on the impacts of transhumant pastoralism on conservation and security in Central Africa. The 2008 National Development Plan for Livestock by the Republic of Chad emphasizes the importance of sustainable development in the livestock sector. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Human-elephant conflict can lead to increased workload, lack of sleep, stress, and poor health for people, impacting their wellbeing. Strategies to mitigate these impacts include monitoring the conflict, implementing prevention and mitigation strategies, and promoting elephant tolerance and co-existence within conservation landscapes. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;The current situation of governance in Central African protected areas shows a shift towards more decentralized models, with the majority now managed by agencies. Local communities are increasingly being involved in the governance and management of protected areas, with some areas under community-based governance or shared governance arrangements. Alternative models are also emerging to include indigenous peoples and local communities in decision-making processes. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;The three broad categories of landscapes in relation to the conflict situation are protected areas, human dominated multi-use landscapes, and human-wildlife project areas. The increase in human-elephant conflicts in recent decades can be attributed to various factors such as changes in land use, human population growth, and lack of effective wildlife management outside of protected areas. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;APN&amp;#x27;s strategy for Akagera Park includes securing the park, developing revenue from tourism, and supporting surrounding rural communities. Tourism in Rwanda&amp;#x27;s national parks has significantly increased since 2000, with visitor numbers jumping from 3,800 to over 110,000 tourists and revenues increasing from US$300,000 to nearly US$29 million. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Conflicts often occur between local people and protected area managers due to a lack of local community participation in management and poor relationships. Strategies implemented to manage these conflicts include gathering information about local communities, seeking their consent, and involving NGOs in collaboration with the government. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Communication is important in a public-private partnership to build trust and understanding between the partners. The private partner has accountability obligations to the State, including managing a public good responsibly and communicating with society. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Social and cultural conflicts related to elephants in Central Africa include encroachment of people into wildlife habitats and the need for co-existence with wildlife. Factors influencing crop consumption by wildlife include biophysical, social, and institutional components, which require a holistic approach to understanding and addressing human-elephant conflict. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Central African countries face challenges in protected area management due to limited resources, reactive rather than proactive approaches, and a lack of consideration for critical underlying factors. Data collection in this context refers to the process of inspecting, cleaning, processing, and modeling data to better understand the situation and facilitate decision-making. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;I&amp;#x27;m sorry, I don&amp;#x27;t have enough information to provide an answer to that question. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;The conflict with forest elephants can lead to increased workload, lack of sleep, stress, and poor health for people involved in protecting crops. Additionally, children may miss school due to having to work overnight to protect farms or being blocked by elephants. This conflict can have long-lasting effects on individuals and communities. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Some of the countries with these numbers of letters in their names are Chad, Peru, and Singapore. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;The three key criteria that should guide this process are quantification, comparability, and change of scale. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;The potential threat identified is the impact of climate change on biodiversity and human populations, particularly in Africa. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;It focuses on biodiversity conservation in Central Africa, providing up-to-date and harmonized data and analysis to inform policy makers and managers. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;I don&amp;#x27;t know, thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;The impact of these factors includes changes in the behavior and movement patterns of elephants, as well as potential effects on vector-borne diseases and their hosts. Climate change, farming practices, human behavior, and environmental factors all play a role in shaping human-elephant conflict and disease transmission. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;The research concluded that information is crucial for protected area management and biodiversity conservation, and a change in culture is needed to fully exploit its potential. They emphasized the importance of establishing a dialogue between data providers, managers, and researchers to ensure a continuous flow of information. The research highlighted the need for user-friendly information systems and well-structured databases to support informed decision-making. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;There have been observed changes in forest loss in Cameroon from 2000 to 2013, as well as impacts on the ecosystem dynamics investigation. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;The three key criteria that should guide this process are quantification, comparability, and change of scale. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;I don&amp;#x27;t know, thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Their goal is to intensify action in the agricultural sector to contain the rise in temperatures to 1.5\\\\u00b0C by drafting a roadmap by COP27. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;These numbers appear to be random and without context, so it is unclear what they mean without further information. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;I don&amp;#x27;t have enough information to calculate the percentage without knowing the total. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Some possible methods to achieve this include community-based monitoring using mobile devices, camera traps to determine raiding patterns, and locally managed insurance schemes. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;I don&amp;#x27;t know, thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;They play a role in negotiating and sharing power to facilitate governance change in protected areas. Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Their aim is to establish integrated community conservation of peatland ecosystems and promote ecotourism in the area, financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) via the World Bank and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Thanks for asking!&quot;,&quot;Protected areas in Central Africa are categorized into national parks (category II), species conservation areas (category IV), and protected areas where sustainable use of biodiversity is allowed (category VI). Thanks for asking!&quot;]],[&quot;reference_answer&quot;,[&quot;Figure 8 illustrates the spatial distribution of mining claims overlapping with protected areas.&quot;,&quot;Mixed protected areas are counted in the terrestrial category because of the small extension of the protected coastal areas.&quot;,&quot;The population growth in pastoral areas is 2.5 to 3.5% per year. This growth will affect the entire Sudanian region in the years to come. Pastoral societies will be unable to absorb the population overflow in the long term. The number of livestock, even if rising sharply, will not be sufficient to support an excessively large population. Currently, numerous young people from pastoralist households already must leave pastoralism to find other means of emancipation and subsistence.&quot;,&quot;NGOs contribute to the protection of natural resources and are involved in defending human rights or the rights of indigenous peoples. They participate in governance and decision-making, making their demands and needs heard. They ensure the application of governance principles and the respect of international commitments made by governments. They are also involved in the preparation of international documents.&quot;,&quot;The context does not provide any information about the significance of the numbers 336, 264, and 281.&quot;,&quot;The context does not provide information on the significance of the numbers.&quot;,&quot;CCC\\\\u2019s goal is to develop tourism in the Congo Basin by offering visitors the opportunity to visit remote and unique forests. The planned investments in both countries will increase the tourism potential of the subregion, generating additional employment and tourism revenues. It aims to create a critical mass to demonstrate to other investors that tourism in the Congo Basin is a viable economic activity that should be undertaken.&quot;,&quot;Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on both flora and fauna in Central Africa. For flora, it is projected that 20 to 30% of plant species will face a greater risk of extinction if global warming exceeds 1.5\\\\u00b0C to 2.5\\\\u00b0C. This is due to loss of suitable habitats and a rise in temperatures which affects the reproduction of many tree species. In terms of fauna, climate change, along with intensifying pressures from human activities, is causing the decline of biodiversity in protected areas. Changes are already noticeable in the geographic distribution of diverse terrestrial and aquatic organisms in response to global warming. Moreover, the populations of various species in Central Africa could decline sharply under the impact of extreme climate events. For example, sedentary antelopes and elephants could be sensitive to severe droughts. Climate change will also alter the flowering and fruiting capacity of vegetation, with cascading effects on all of the species which depend on it.&quot;,&quot;Tourism revenue in Virunga National Park was approximately US$4 million in 2017.&quot;,&quot;It is estimated that a minimum of 30% of the Earth\\\\u2019s surface must be protected through conservation measures, including 10% under strong protection.&quot;,&quot;Waza National Park was the protected area receiving the highest number of tourists according to a study conducted a few years ago.&quot;,&quot;Compensations are cumbersome and slow to administer, insufficient and are often delayed for months and occasionally even years. Public funds are not enough to cover all compensation claims. There are various flaws that include: slow administration, so that people must wait for a long time before receiving a payment; unfair payments, as most often only a fraction of the actual value of the loss is paid and payments might be given to some but not all claimants.&quot;,&quot;The objective of SOPA 2020 is to contribute to a more effective use of approaches and tools for collecting and analysing data on protected area management in Central Africa. It aims to provide an overview of their importance with regard to global changes, but also to situate protected areas within national and regional territories. This document is intended to be used by administrations in charge of protected areas, policy makers, technical and financial partners, research institutions, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and anyone else interested in biodiversity conservation in Central Africa.&quot;,&quot;The challenges include: parasites and diseases which diminish honey production and could also have a negative effect on the efficiency of beehives as elephant deterrents; bee stings which could discourage people from practicing beekeeping; the inability to maintain beehives at the optimum activity level could lead to a failure of the hive to deter elephants.&quot;,&quot;The main reasons behind the increasing human-elephant conflict in Central Africa include the continuous immigration and expansion of people into forest lands, the increase of the density of the last elephant populations repelled in these forest tracks, the lack of effective mitigation methods, and potentially an increase in so-called problem elephants. Other factors include climate change, which has led to a decrease in the fruiting of natural forest trees over the past 30 years, pushing elephants out of the woods.&quot;,&quot;Crop raiding by elephants can lead to significant damage and financial implications for human lives and livelihoods, particularly for those living in agricultural communities.&quot;,&quot;The area of oil and gas claims which extend over protected areas has increased from 221,467\\\\u2009km2 to 422,787\\\\u2009km2 since 2018.&quot;,&quot;Pastoral systems manage 80% of Central African livestock.&quot;,&quot;The impact of human-elephant conflict can significantly affect people&amp;#x27;s wellbeing.&quot;,&quot;African Parks Network pioneered the implementation of delegated management partnerships in Africa and holds the largest number of contracts with governments of the subregion.&quot;,&quot;The types of management modes used for protected areas in Central Africa include delegated management, co-management, and public-private partnerships. Delegated management and co-management often distinguish the degree of collaboration between the two partners. Public-private partnerships are not-for-profit and any revenue from the partnership is first invested in the protected area before being used to potentially provide support to communities on the outskirts of the protected area or the public partner.&quot;,&quot;The main objective of the Integrated Management Effectiveness Tool (IMET) is to support the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of protected areas to improve management and ensure the achievement of conservation objectives. It is beneficial as it provides a comprehensive set of decision-support tools for protected area managers, organizations, and biodiversity conservation agencies. The tool covers all elements of the protected area management cycle, facilitates exchanges between stakeholders for participatory decision-making, and helps improve management efforts and reporting on protected areas.&quot;,&quot;Spatial aspects and the presence of certain types of crops can affect the susceptibility of farms to crop raiding by African elephants.&quot;,&quot;As of July 2020, 13 partnerships have been contracted, managing a total area of c. 205,000\\\\u2009km2.&quot;,&quot;1. It recognizes that all wildlife is wild, and conflict will occur. When conflicts occur however, the interventions across the system should ensure that the impact of an incident does not exceed the limits of community tolerance and does not result in retaliatory killing. 2. It stresses that individuals, communities, leaders and the public involved in the design of the system need to accept and share responsibility for the safety of the system, and those that use the system must accept responsibility for complying with the rules and constraints of the system. 3. It aligns conflict management decisions with wider development plans and processes that contribute to economic, human and environmental goals. 4. It guides interventions to meet the minimum standards and long-term goals, rather than setting specific targets.&quot;,&quot;The exchange rate used was: \\\\u20ac x 1.21741 = US$.&quot;,&quot;The TRIDOM landscape is characterized by its rich biological diversity, with the largest forest elephant populations in Central Africa, low fragmentation and very low disturbance. It covers 97% of the entire landscape. TRIDOM is known to be an important reservoir of iron ore, which is found in Cameroon, Gabon and Congo.&quot;,&quot;Integrating young pastoralists into conservation programs can be an opportunity because their knowledge of the environment can contribute considerably to conservation efforts.&quot;,&quot;The forests in Central Africa play a crucial role in regulating local and regional climates. They maintain rainfall levels up to several thousand kilometers inland. In contrast, rainfall decreases exponentially in deforested areas with distance from the sea. They also store significant amounts of carbon, contributing substantially to climate equilibrium at local, regional, and continental levels.&quot;,&quot;Socio-political studies on transhumant groups should serve as a lever to integrate transhumant pastoralists into political consultation processes and to improve the effectiveness of the interventions of protected area managers.&quot;,&quot;The Okapi Fund became operational in 2019. Its first interventions are planned for 2022 and will benefit Kahuzi-Biega and Garamba National Parks, two World Heritage sites.&quot;,&quot;In the short term, fiscal and financial measures are needed, such as renegotiating bank and credit terms for existing tourism structures, if required with the support of the States in the form of bank guarantees. The establishment of micro-credit capacities and the creation of professional support funds would make it possible to compensate \\\\u2013 at least in part \\\\u2013 for the absence of insurance or unemployment benefits. Other avenues for public funding of protected areas and ecotourism can be considered, such as the allocation of part of the revenues from tourist and airport taxes. More generally, it is the responsibility of States to develop integrated, sustainable and equitable tourism development policies, which must be based on three pillars: 1) strengthen the protection of heritage (natural and cultural), 2) provide a secure legal and economic environment for investors, and 3) allow for a better sharing of costs and benefits among stakeholders. The growth of ecotourism requires significant investments in infrastructure, facilitating the movement of tourists and training of staff at all levels.&quot;,&quot;Methods including community-based monitoring using mobile devices and camera traps are being used to monitor crop raiding by forest elephants in Central Africa. Community-based monitoring allows for real-time documentation and requires local data collectors to be trained and supervised over several years. Camera traps help to determine raiding patterns, such as timing and location, as well as age and sex patterns of crop-raiding elephants.&quot;,&quot;The vigilance committees face difficulties such as death threats made by poachers who are arrested, cases of complicity between some committee members and poachers, a lack of legal coverage, non-responsiveness of the government which leads to discouragement, and a lack of adequate equipment.&quot;,&quot;The Ebola outbreak killed 5000 gorillas.&quot;,&quot;Since the first partnership contracts were signed in 2005, major changes have resulted in a second generation of contracts. This evolution notably includes greater ownership by governments, which have formulated increasingly detailed expectations. For instance, the Garamba contract in 2005 only contained seven pages without specific expectations; in 2016, the contract had extended to 24 pages and included specific targets.&quot;,&quot;The oversight committees face difficulties such as death threats made by arrested poachers, cases of complicity between some committee members and poachers, a lack of legal coverage, non-responsiveness of the government, and a lack of adequate equipment.&quot;,&quot;The Soci\\\\u00e9t\\\\u00e9 Equatoriale des Mines (SEM) in Gabon plans to support the creation of gold miner cooperatives. This state-owned enterprise intends to assist, train and equip gold miners so that they can engage in an activity that will enable them to generate income over an extended period of time. If this initiative becomes a reality, it could help to formalize this activity to a certain extent, and to integrate consideration of environmental concerns.&quot;,&quot;The main reasons for increasing human-elephant conflicts in Central Africa include the continuous immigration and expansion of people into forest lands, the increase of the density of the last elephant populations repelled in these forest tracks, the lack of effective mitigation methods, and potentially an increase in so-called problem elephants. Additionally, climate change and the decrease in fruiting of natural forest trees have also contributed to this issue.&quot;,&quot;The main threats to the biodiversity of the Itombwe Nature Reserve are many threats associated with human activities, including mining, the expansion of settlements around Zombe, the felling of trees for fuelwood, and high demographic growth due to the workforce of artisanal diggers.&quot;,&quot;The Africa Mining Vision (AMV) is a general framework for the development of mining resources, adopted by the African Union in 2009. It recommends improving the conditions for negotiating mining contracts, paying more attention to the environment, and ensuring the best use of natural resources and the development of African skills.&quot;,&quot;1. Recognize the contribution of information to the effective, proactive and targeted management of protected areas and the overall environment. 2. Make the most of the knowledge and experience of field actors by combining these with information produced by scientists and other data providers. 3. Orient the collection of data and knowledge around well-targeted management objectives in a results-oriented management framework. 4. Develop synergies and design coordinated data collection approaches by promoting more direct involvement of managers in identifying and formulating information needs. 5. Ensure better use of the information available by facilitating access and effective use for operational purposes. 6. Guarantee, with the support of observatories (in particular OFAC), the use of instruments such as IMET and SMART, which allow the information available at the site level to be used through its analysis and translation into targeted operational indications. 7. Promote information sharing and transparency. 8. Use information to lobby for the mobilization of resources needed for effective management of protected areas.&quot;,&quot;Since the 1990s, the protected area networks of the countries in the subregion have expanded and now better cover the entire spectrum of biodiversity. Central African countries have or will be able to achieve Aichi Target 11 (17% of territories classified as protected areas) \\\\u2013 at least on land \\\\u2013 or even the 30% target under negotiation. These countries also play a role in maintaining green (vegetation) and blue (water) frameworks over vast territories.&quot;,&quot;The Association for Surveillance and Sustainable Development (ASSD), officially recognized by the Congolese authorities, is organized in each village. These ASSDs elect two people to represent them on the Foundation\\\\u2019s Board of Directors. These representatives are elected democratically at the general assemblies of the village associations after everyone has campaigned. The communities can now have a voice in the management of the park and participate in discussions on the selection and funding of micro development projects in the various villages.&quot;,&quot;The proofreading for the project was provided by SAUGET Marie (Milpa Communication), BIGOMBE LOGO Patrice (CERAD), BOBO KADIRI Serge (University of Dschang), and HAKIZUMWAMI Elie (WRI).&quot;,&quot;Developing a tourism project with western lowland gorillas will be more expensive and time consuming than one with mountain gorillas. Complete habituation can take up to eight years, compared to two years for mountain gorillas. Lowland gorilla tracking requires skilled trackers to be able to find the same group every day in the understory of dense forests, especially during the dry season. Moreover, lowland gorillas have larger overlapping home ranges, and they usually live in smaller groups. This makes it crucial to follow them daily, but also makes it more difficult to track the same group of gorillas, which slows the habituation process. In addition, western gorillas are sympatric with forest elephants throughout their home range, which can be dangerous when tourists are viewing the gorillas or traveling to and from habituated gorilla groups.&quot;,&quot;(i) The area\\\\u2019s management and governance systems have been operating for at least 2 years, (ii) there is a low risk that the assessment will lead to conflicts between or within different groups of actors, (iii) all key actors are willing to commit themselves to the assessment, (iv) the lead facilitator must be independent and considered to be neutral by all actors, (v) key actors commit to supporting short and medium-term actions in response to the assessment\\\\u2019s results.&quot;,&quot;Tourism contributes to the partial or total financing of parks such as Akagera and Volcanoes, and provides significant financial resources for other protected areas. It also provides employment opportunities and helps finance community projects in very poor rural areas, helping to anchor protected areas and tourism activity in rural territories.&quot;,&quot;The context does not provide information about the significance of the numbers 368 and 363.&quot;,&quot;The Soci\\\\u00e9t\\\\u00e9 Equatoriale des Mines (SEM) in Gabon plans to support the creation of gold miner cooperatives. This state-owned enterprise was established to oversee the development of the mining sector and manage government holdings in mining projects. SEM plans to assist, train and equip gold miners so that they can engage in an activity that will enable them to generate income over an extended period of time.&quot;,&quot;There is an increase in human-elephant conflict correlated with the poaching of elephants in Burkina Faso.&quot;,&quot;The study by Van de Perre F., Willig M.R., Presley S.J., et al., 2018 focuses on reconciling biodiversity and carbon stock conservation in an Afrotropical forest landscape.&quot;,&quot;The estimated potential for the establishment of secondary forests in protected areas in CAR is about 10,465\\\\u2009km2 for medium potential and 46,029\\\\u2009km2 for high potential.&quot;,&quot;In Central Africa, there are currently almost 4,590 awarded mining contracts covering an area of 502,150\\\\u2009km2. These mining claims largely spare the Central Congo Basin. However, they do occupy extensive land in two major geographic zones: the first encompasses the entire South Congo - Gabon - Cameroon axis, the second occupies all of the landscape and ancient lands bordering the Congo Basin, mainly in the east (Albertine Rift) and south (Kasai and Katanga plateaus). Within this ensemble, 167 awarded claims overlap protected areas, covering just over 42,500\\\\u2009km2, or 3.7% of Central Africa\\\\u2019s protected areas. If mining claim applications are added, the total number of concessions overlapping protected areas covers 4.6% of their surface. The impact of mines on biodiversity is often much greater than that of onshore oil wells, particularly when the latter observe appropriate measures. Illegal artisanal mining and semi-artisanal mining are widespread, causing a great deal of both ecological and social damage.&quot;,&quot;Cameroon and Gabon have the highest percentages of overlap between mining claims and Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs), at 30% and 27% respectively.&quot;,&quot;Three key elements constitute a PPP: a contractual document between the public and private partners that clearly defines the roles, responsibilities and commitments of the two parties; the public partner delegates to the private partner all or part of its prerogatives, in particular the management of the protected area\\\\u2018s staff (including government employees); the private partner provides or raises funding and manages the funds necessary for the operational management of the protected area (investment and operations).&quot;,&quot;1. Avoid: this consists of modifying a particular project or activity to remove a negative impact that the project or activity could generate. When the impacts are too great and the activity incompatible with sustainable development principles, the project may be cancelled. 2. Reduce: this consists of reducing a project\\\\u2019s negative impacts on the environment, whether these impacts are permanent or temporary, take place in the present or future, or occur in exploration, installation or operational phases. Reduction measures can achieve several outcomes; they can reduce the impact\\\\u2019s duration, intensity, scope, or a combination of these. 3. Offset: this consists of compensating for any significant direct or indirect negative effects generated by a project that could not be avoided or sufficiently reduced. Compensation measures must make it possible to preserve and, if possible, improve the quality of an environment. They include measures to restore degraded sites and compensate for residual damage to ensure, at a minimum, that there is no net loss of biodiversity. If possible, a net gain in biodiversity should be sought.&quot;,&quot;SMART and IBA do not consider elements related to &amp;#x27;Climate change&amp;#x27;.&quot;,&quot;The main factors that accelerated the migration of transhumant pastoralists towards eastern CAR and DRC in the early 2000s include a series of droughts, repressive political events, shifting fronts of insecurity following civil wars in DRC and Sudan, and economic opportunities that sometimes opened up around protected areas and refugee camps.&quot;,&quot;The environmental impacts of these illegal practices are disastrous. They range from erosion to the diversion of watercourses through siltation. This activity generates several impacts, including deforestation and forest degradation, ecosystem pollution, poaching and fragmentation of wildlife habitats, alongside a deterioration in the living and working conditions of the gold miners.&quot;,&quot;CAFI stands for Central African Forest Initiative.&quot;,&quot;RAPAC stands for &amp;#x27;R\\\\u00e9seaux des Aires Prot\\\\u00e9g\\\\u00e9es d\\\\u2019Afrique Centrale&amp;#x27; and its English translation is &amp;#x27;Network of Central African Protected Areas&amp;#x27;.&quot;,&quot;In Rwanda, parks were open for part of the year, which helped to limit losses. A rigorous process was put in place and all visitors were required to present a negative Covid test, both immediately prior to and upon arrival at the parks. Gorilla tourism has been reopened, with revenues falling by less than in other countries, despite the drop in visits and lower rates for domestic visitors.&quot;,&quot;The challenges in implementing national action plans for elephant conservation in Central Africa include a lack of political will, conflicts of interest, particularly with other ministries, and a lack of funding to roll out human-wildlife conflict programs.&quot;,&quot;Illegal gold mining leads to massive invasion by foreigners and environmental destruction.&quot;,&quot;In their 2010 study, Hedges &amp;amp; Gunaryadi suggested that using chilies can help deter elephants from entering crop fields, thereby reducing human-elephant conflict.&quot;,&quot;Direct impacts of human-elephant conflict include crop loss, property destruction, and injury. Indirect or hidden impacts include the opportunity costs of added expenditures and workload, such as staying up overnight to protect crops, which can lead to lack of sleep, increased stress, and poorer health. There can also be poor nutritional status, and children might not be able to attend school if they must work overnight to protect the farms or if an elephant blocks the roads. Additionally, there are intangible costs which are non-monetary, temporally delayed, and often psychological in nature, such as fear, stress, sleep deprivation or in extreme cases, grief over a death.&quot;,&quot;The main constraints are insufficient financial and logistical resources, weak staff capacities in the field and in central services, inadequate staffing levels, and institutional instability. These issues result in difficulties in managing and using available data, institutional instability leading to rapid staff rotations and loss of data, politicians&amp;#x27; limited interest in conservation, and difficulty in managing and using available data.&quot;,&quot;The report &amp;#x27;A review of the threat of oil exploitation to mangrove ecosystem: Insights from Niger Delta, Nigeria&amp;#x27; provides insights into the threat of oil exploitation to the mangrove ecosystem in the Niger Delta, Nigeria.&quot;,&quot;The guidelines available for protected area managers to adapt to climate change are provided by the IUCN SSC, in their document titled &amp;#x27;Adapting to Climate Change: guidance for protected area managers and planners&amp;#x27;. Additionally, Misrachi M. &amp;amp; Belle E., also provide guidelines for protected area managers in the context of climate change.&quot;,&quot;The decline of the Lossi Gorilla Sanctuary in Congo was due to the devastating effects of the Ebola epidemics that broke out in the Districts of Mbomo and Kell\\\\u00e9 from December 2001 until 2005. These epidemics resulted in the deaths of more than 80 local people, as well as gorillas and chimpanzees. The epidemics led to the loss of the habituated gorilla group, which was the sanctuary\\\\u2019s main tourism attraction, bringing in significant revenue for the communities. Following these epidemics, the support needed to sustain this pilot experience disappeared. The primatology researchers left the area and moved to the outskirts of the sanctuary, and the financial support that the project initially received dried up.&quot;,&quot;Only nationally classified protected areas included in WDPA are considered in the connectivity of protected areas in Figure 9.&quot;,&quot;CCC\\\\u2019s goal is to develop tourism in the Congo Basin by offering visitors the opportunity to visit remote and unique forests. The planned investments in both countries will increase the tourism potential of the subregion, generating additional employment and tourism revenues. It will create a critical mass to demonstrate to other investors that tourism in the Congo Basin is a viable economic activity that should be undertaken.&quot;,&quot;Increased urban development in or near forests leads to increased contact between humans and vectors in peri-urban forested areas. This results in more vector breeding sites due to deforestation and increased human entry into forests, as well as increased surface water in soils exposed by logging or agriculture.&quot;,&quot;Ninety percent of the gas produced during the oil operations in Gabon is flared, vented or reinjected into the oil extraction wells. The remaining gas is exploited by Perenco on two fields, Ganga and Ozangue, which supply the thermal power plants of Libreville and Port-Gentil.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of the partnership between the Congolese government and APN for the management of PNOK is to improve the park\\\\u2019s governance and the effectiveness of its management. APN aims to contribute to the government\\\\u2019s efforts regarding the social and economic development of local communities and the development of income-generating activities, but also in activities likely to contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of the park\\\\u2019s natural resources.&quot;,&quot;The title of the annual report from African Parks in 2019 is &amp;#x27;Quand l\\\\u2019espoir devient r\\\\u00e9alit\\\\u00e9.&amp;#x27;&quot;,&quot;Sentinel indicators are used to monitor key elements of a system in order to monitor and provide information about relationships of mutual influence between different actors and their context. They are not used to measure the outcome of an activity, but rather as a signal to indicate an important change in a key element within a complex system. They should be easy to collect and communicate, and signal the need for more in-depth analysis and investigation. Sentinel indicators support adaptive and proactive project management, and are not tied to a fixed objective. They can provide important information for the management of protected areas, including aspects that may be more strongly impacted by the consequences of the pandemic and by restrictive measures adopted by different governments.&quot;,&quot;Funding plays a crucial role in public-private partnerships for Central African delegated management contracts. Eight out of 13 contracts explicitly mention financing on a park with management in their titles. In half of the delegated management contracts that have been analyzed, raising funds is explicitly expected from the private partner, and its non-fulfillment, generally over two years, could be a reason to dissolve the contract.&quot;,&quot;The context does not provide information on the significance of the numbers 208, 188, 281, and 142.&quot;,&quot;The concern is that the oil and mining claims in the Central Congo Basin may not be managed to limit environmental impacts. Certain oil companies may be less sensitive to environmental issues and the risks of pollution are higher in wetland areas. Much of the mining sector operates illegally and is largely unconcerned by the environmental and social impacts of extraction activities. In Central Africa, there are currently almost 4,590 awarded mining contracts covering an area of 502,150 km2. These mining claims largely spare the Central Congo Basin but occupy extensive land in two major geographic zones: the South Congo - Gabon - Cameroon axis, and the landscape and ancient lands bordering the Congo Basin, mainly in the east (Albertine Rift) and south (Kasai and Katanga plateaus).&quot;,&quot;Mining claims overlap only marginally with oil and gas contracts in Central African forests, but the total area affected by extraction permits reaches more than 60% of Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs). The regions most impacted by mining claims, such as eastern DRC and the Gabon-Cameroon region, are also the richest in biodiversity among Central African forests, and hold many endemic species. The environmental impacts of mining activities may be more damaging in these regions than in some of the Congo Basin\\\\u2019s terra firma forests. Additionally, there are currently almost 4,590 awarded mining contracts covering an area of 502,150\\\\u2009km2 in Central Africa. Within this ensemble, 167 awarded claims overlap protected areas, covering just over 42,500\\\\u2009km2, or 3.7% of Central Africa\\\\u2019s protected areas. If mining claim applications are added, the total number of concessions overlapping protected areas covers 4.6% of their surface. The impact of mines on biodiversity is often much greater than that of onshore oil wells, particularly when the latter observe appropriate measures.&quot;,&quot;Between 2002 and 2010, 95% of the elephants in Zakouma National Park, representing nearly 4,000 animals, were slaughtered by poachers for their ivory tusks. Three conclusions can be drawn from this experience: 1) the 4,000 elephants killed came not only from Zakouma Park but also from neighboring countries; 2) the losses could have been limited through a proactive approach formulated on the basis of information from several sites, shared between countries, and regional collaboration; and 3) the resources invested in the protection and restoration of the surviving elephant population of Zakouma Park are considerably higher than the costs of management based on preventive information.&quot;,&quot;Martin HEGA was the former Director of the WCS Gabon Monts de Cristal Project, who worked for the SWM-CIRAD sustainable wildlife management project. He was deeply committed to the conservation of nature for over twenty years, with a genuine interest in people, especially rural communities. He initiated and contributed to many conservation, awareness-raising and capacity-building activities for biodiversity management stakeholders in the field. He was also one of the senior coaches in the process of assessing protected area management effectiveness using the IMET tool since 2016.&quot;,&quot;The three key criteria for data collection in biodiversity conservation are quantification, comparability, and change of scale. The main challenges related to the continuous updating of information on protected areas include the total absence of standards for data transmission systems and for clear workflow within protected areas and between these areas and the administrations concerned.&quot;,&quot;BDI stands for Burundi and TCD represents Chad.&quot;,&quot;A thorough understanding of all dimensions of the conflict is crucial for any human-wildlife conflict program to be successful, as only a few studies in Central Africa have systematically aimed to fully understand the diverse components of human-wildlife or elephant conflict and its underlying drivers. To address human-elephant conflict, a holistic approach is proposed that integrates both biological and social science methods to the complex issues, including the use of sociological methods such as participant observation, which has proven to provide more insights into the various dimensions of the conflict. This approach advocates for increased elephant tolerance and human-elephant co-existence within conservation landscapes, as well as for more mitigation methods where elephants are compressed into small protected areas.&quot;,&quot;The most notable development in Central Africa over the last five years has been the increase in the number of marine protected areas, and the two types of protected areas with international status are World Heritage sites and wetlands of international importance known as &amp;#x27;Ramsar sites&amp;#x27;.&quot;,&quot;Hunting areas in Central Africa are significant for biodiversity conservation due to their immense size and the role they play in maintaining natural environments and large mammal populations. However, they are declining due to increased operational costs from agricultural encroachment and poaching, as well as reduced profits from a decline in the trophy hunting market.&quot;,&quot;Protected areas contribute to climate change mitigation by optimizing carbon sequestration and storage, preventing deforestation and land degradation, sheltering diverse species, and providing ecosystem goods and services. They enhance resilience to climate change effects for ecosystems and human populations. The Global Climate Fund supports actions in Central Africa such as clean energy production projects, particularly solar, and land-use planning and reforestation projects, promoting low-carbon development and carbon storage.&quot;,&quot;SAPA is used for assessing the positive and negative social impacts of protected areas on the well-being of communities living in and around these areas, with the aim of poverty reduction. On the other hand, SAGE is a method used to assess the governance and equity of measures to conserve biodiversity, ecosystem services and other conservation-support actions, such as cost-benefit sharing programs.&quot;,&quot;The report by Luizza M., 2017 focuses on transhumant pastoralism in Central Africa and its new impacts on conservation and security, while the 2008 National Development Plan for Livestock by the Republic of Chad focuses on the development of livestock from 2009-2016.&quot;,&quot;The impact of human-elephant conflict on people&amp;#x27;s wellbeing can be significant, often resulting in crop-damage and financial implications for conservation programs. Strategies for mitigating this conflict have included long-term management of crop raiding by elephants, translocation of problem elephants, and development of a spatially-explicit, sustainable and risk-based insurance scheme.&quot;,&quot;The governance of protected areas in Central Africa is undergoing a profound change and is at a crossroads between consolidation and continuous improvement in some countries, and hesitation and resistance in others. The sharing of responsibilities with local communities is being tested in various sites but is still in its infancy. In some cases, structures and procedures have been put in place to effectively involve local communities in decision-making.&quot;,&quot;The three categories are: 1. Isolated protected areas where elephants primarily range inside protected areas and sometimes move out of them. 2. Large relatively intact forest landscape and protected area networks where forest elephants move freely. 3. Human dominated multi-use landscapes, dominated by agricultural land and large commercial plantations, where there is a conflict of interest between farmers and those who wish to protect the remaining elephant populations. The increase in human-elephant conflicts has been caused by the expansion of commercial logging, mining activities and development corridors, the development of infrastructure and roads, and encroachment from people coming from outside these landscapes. This has resulted in an intensification of farming, more sedentary settlements, and shorter fallow periods, causing an expansion of agricultural areas into forest elephant habitats.&quot;,&quot;APN&amp;#x27;s strategy for Akagera Park includes securing the park, developing revenue from tourism, and supporting surrounding rural communities, which has resulted in the restoration of the park&amp;#x27;s wildlife resources, the establishment of professional tourism management, the arrival of a luxury operator, and effective marketing. Since the beginning of 2000, the number of visitors to Rwanda&amp;#x27;s three parks has increased from 3,800 to over 110,000 tourists, and tourism revenues have jumped from US$300,000 to nearly US$29 million, with much of this revenue coming from the Volcanoes National Park and gorilla tourism.&quot;,&quot;Conflicts between local people and protected area managers are common due to a lack of local community participation in the management of protected areas, and occasionally poor relationships between local people and protected area managers. Some managers have established mechanisms for conflict resolution and collaboration with local communities. For example, in Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda, the administration promotes environmental information and education, develops joint mechanisms for managing conflicts, and allocates a portion of the income generated from tourism in the park to socioeconomic projects chosen jointly by district representatives, park officers and sector officers.&quot;,&quot;Communication is vital in a public-private partnership for developing a trust-based relationship between the partners, allowing them to understand each other better and build a solid relationship of trust. The private partner has an important duty of accountability, mainly to the State, and must communicate with society so that its actions are understood and accepted.&quot;,&quot;In Central Africa, conflicts arise between farmers accusing their neighbors of witchcraft and transforming into elephants to destroy their plantations. Perceptions of elephants vary depending on ethnic and residency backgrounds. Factors influencing crop consumption by wildlife include differences in wildlife habitats and farming patterns. Each location has unique factors affecting the pattern and intensity of crop raiding. Understanding these factors is crucial to design crop protection methods and mitigate human-wildlife conflicts.&quot;,&quot;Central African countries are facing significant challenges in protected area management, including limited government funding, need for clear management and conservation objectives, human resources, and current legislation, requiring effective management plans. In this context, &amp;#x27;data collection&amp;#x27; refers to the systematic approach of gathering and measuring information from various sources to gain a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the area, helping to answer relevant questions, assess results, and better predict future probabilities and trends.&quot;,&quot;Protected areas play an important role in the fight against climate change. They contribute to halting deforestation and reducing carbon stocks, promoting long-term carbon storage and increasing stocks in areas where forests are regenerating. They also enable the development of actions for the adaptation of human communities to climate change. Additionally, they can potentially access funds allocated for both climate change mitigation and adaptation, if their carbon storage function and their key role in reducing emissions from deforestation and ecosystem degradation is included in strategies.&quot;,&quot;Human-wildlife conflict, particularly poaching and anthropogenic change, have significant consequences for the survival of African forest elephants.&quot;,&quot;Conflicts around protected areas in Central Africa can be linked to the creation of the protected areas, which often involves forced displacement of communities and plundering of their natural resources. Tensions arise around access to wildlife, from which the communities are excluded. Activities such as agriculture, hunting, and infrastructure construction projects continue to encroach on protected areas, impacting their integrity. This encroachment is a consequence of the communities\\\\u2019 poverty, as well as their resistance to the creation of protected areas. Another type of conflict is between humans and wildlife that approach villages and devastate crops. These conflicts are exacerbated by factors such as prevailing insecurity in the subregion and in neighboring countries, and the abusive behavior of some eco-guards toward local and indigenous communities.&quot;,&quot;The three key criteria are quantification, which is the need to quantify data as accurately as possible, comparability, which is the possibility to compare the situation and performance of different protected areas regarding specific aspects, and scaling up, which is the ability to perform analyses at the level of protected area systems (national, regional or ecosystem) based on information on individual protected areas.&quot;,&quot;The potential threat to tropical intact forest landscapes is the extractive industries.&quot;,&quot;The 2020 African Development Bank report focuses on economic perspectives in Central Africa in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot;,&quot;The title of the methodology developed by Dudley N. and Stolton S. in 2009 is &amp;#x27;The Protected Areas Benefits Assessment Tool.&amp;#x27;&quot;,&quot;The advance of the agriculture front on the savannas and the pastoralism area, and the growth in livestock numbers stemming from transhumant pastoralists settling in more permanently and from investments in livestock by farming inhabitants, are the main causes of the degradation of wildlife resources. These dynamics are behind the increase in conflicts between pastoralists and farmers, between pastoralists themselves, and more generally between people and wildlife.&quot;,&quot;Mansourian S., Belokurov A. &amp;amp; Stephenson P., in their 2009 study, discussed the role of protected forest areas in climate change adaptation.&quot;,&quot;Since the first partnership contracts were signed in 2005, major changes have resulted in a second generation of contracts. This evolution notably includes greater ownership by governments, which have formulated increasingly detailed expectations. The example of the Garamba contract is instructive. In 2005, it only contained seven pages without specific expectations; in 2016, the contract had extended to 24 pages and included specific targets.&quot;,&quot;The three key criteria that should guide data collection are quantification, comparability, and scaling up. Quantification refers to the need to quantify data as accurately as possible. Comparability refers to the ability to compare the situation and performance of different protected areas regarding specific aspects. Scaling up refers to the ability to perform analyses at the level of protected area systems (national, regional or ecosystem) based on information on individual protected areas.&quot;,&quot;In the context of Central Africa, &amp;#x27;COG&amp;#x27; stands for Republic of Congo.&quot;,&quot;CCC\\\\u2019s goal is to develop tourism in the Congo Basin by offering visitors the opportunity to visit remote and unique forests.&quot;,&quot;By effective inclusive participation, we mean that government institutions, local communities, the private sector and civil society are involved in decision-making processes in a manner that is transparent and accountable to all relevant stakeholders.&quot;,&quot;30% of the visitors in Mefou Park are &amp;#x27;national&amp;#x27;, including resident foreigners but also Cameroonians.&quot;,&quot;Strategies to increase tolerance for co-existence with wildlife include raising community awareness about the ecological role of wildlife and the dangers of establishing new farms in elephant habitats, reducing intangible costs of living with wildlife, and increasing intangible benefits. This can be achieved through activities such as knowledge increase, reducing intangible costs, and increasing intangible benefits. Informing the local, regional and national decision-makers is also crucial. In addition, prevention and mitigation activities that can reduce the monetary costs of co-existence, particularly when they are based on strong community support and are combined with alternative income-generating activities, can also be employed.&quot;,&quot;Central Africa alone holds more than 16% of intertropical above-ground carbon.&quot;,&quot;The Ndami Collective works in agreement with the management unit of the reserve to inform communities (such as raising awareness about savanna fires) and, above all, in the resolution of conflicts related to land tenure and good natural resource management. The members of the collective are elected according to the customary rules of the sociocultural groups living in and around the reserve, mainly the Bomitaba.&quot;,&quot;The aim of the guidelines developed by Booth and P. Chardonnet in 2015 is to improve the administration of sustainable hunting in sub-Saharan Africa.&quot;,&quot;Mixed protected areas (terrestrial and marine) are counted in the terrestrial category because of the small extension of the protected coastal areas.&quot;]],[&quot;id&quot;,[653,152,565,167,812,221,819,888,813,51,810,479,45,523,424,532,676,550,532,255,245,393,530,242,543,901,687,591,871,594,106,832,454,92,842,243,113,660,424,664,614,366,95,189,15,771,401,839,893,660,501,965,931,658,681,256,619,387,574,661,30,31,862,457,740,512,431,330,716,968,193,88,819,895,636,189,840,320,259,494,683,683,317,5,334,406,436,62,67,868,400,604,501,219,416,802,442,271,445,377,934,508,111,334,731,720,371,566,953,257,335,406,784,219,809,488,871,185,129,977]],[&quot;content&quot;,[&quot;270\\\\nFigure\\\\u202f6 - Spatial distribution of oil and gas claims overlapping with protected areas\\\\nSource: WWF-SIGHT&quot;,&quot;These two categories partly overlap as some of the international protected areas also have \\\\nnational status.
