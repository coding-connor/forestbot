One in particular is the \npopulation growth of pastoralist communities. \nSince the middle of the 20th century, the popu-\nlation in the Sahel has more than tripled. Following \na similar dynamic, the current population growth in \npastoral areas is 2.5 to 3.5% per year. The populations \nwho depend on pastoralism may thus double every 25 \nto 35 years (African Union, 2010). The impact of this \ngrowth will affect the entire Sudanian region in the \nyears to come. \nPastoral societies will be unable to absorb the \npopulation overflow in the long term. The number of \nlivestock, even if rising sharply, will not be sufficient \nto support an excessively large population. Currently, \nnumerous young people from pastoralist households \nalready must leave pastoralism to find other means of \nemancipation and subsistence. Some take up farming, \npick up a trade or join the government if they have a \nsufficient level of education. They thereby put an end \nto their mobility. They nonetheless remain culturally \nlinked to pastoralism, and still invest some of their \nincome in the purchase of livestock. They keep the \nanimals near their camps or on the outskirts of the \nurban centers where they live and work. \nThe owners in questions do not practice transhu-\nmance, but their animals join those of trans\u00ad\nhumant \npastoralists and other agropastoralists on the \npasturelands during the dry season. Once their \nherds have reached a certain size, some owners, who \nmay be businessmen or government bureaucrats, \nhire young herders to escort their animals to more \nremote pasturelands. When traveling, these young \nherders do not always respect the boundaries of \ntranshumance corridors or the management rules \ngoverned by and negotiated with local institutions \nand state authorities. These situations are often at \nthe root of major local conflicts when the animals \ndestroy farmers\u2019 fields. \nOther young pastoralists are not thriving and are \nlimiting themselves to small holdings.\n\nDocument 563: 230\nlife habitats. On the other hand, the overall herd size \nof wealthy pastoralists developing \u201centreprenurial\u201d \npastoralism is increasing exponentially, involving new \npractices that do not include the historical, cultural, \nsocial and societal features of pastoralism, and which \nare considered to be the main causes of local conflicts \nand the destruction of wildlife habitats. \n1.3.4 Pastoral areas on the fringes of \nagricultural development\nDespite considerable social, economic and polit-\nical progress, transhumant pastoralists generally are \nsubject to a certain degree of cultural and spatial \nisolation. In pastoralist regions, human development \nindicators remain poor, and the provision of public \nservices is limited. Basic services are largely inac-\ncessible for transhumant pastoralists. The remote \nconditions of pastoralist regions often justify a \nlow-level of government investment. Furthermore, \ndecision makers promoting territorial development \nprograms have long overlooked transhumant commu-\nnities. Mobility is often perceived to be an obstacle to \nthe organization of space. Pastoral systems continue \nto be described as \u201ctraditional\u201d. The \u201cmulti-scale\u201d \n\u00ad\ncharacter of transhumant livestock systems (disper-\nsion of production spaces and marketing spaces) \nconfers on them a reputation of being systems that \nare difficult to control (Harchies et al., 2007). As a \nresult, public territorial development initiatives rarely \nconsider the dynamics of transhumant pastoralists\u2019 \nuse of space (Binot et al., 2006).\nA question to consider is whether the agricultural \npolicies for agro-industry development implemented \nbetween 1990 and 2000 also had a significant impact \non transhumant pastoral systems. Pastoral land used \non a seasonal basis was considerably reduced in favor \nof other, more intensive agricultural uses (dry season \nsorghum, locally known as berbere, and cotton). \nAgricultural intensification programs, increased areas \nunder cultivation and improvements in agricultural \ntechniques (for example, irrigation, extension of \ncotton crops) have sometimes directly influenced the \nrise in conflicts between farmers and pastoralists.\n\nDocument 561: 229\nspread renting of arms to criminals and rebels, which \nis further increasing demand among pastoralists. \nTo avoid rebellion movements, herders are heading \ntowards remote border areas which are vast, marginal-\nized territories where there is little central government \ncontrol. In CAR, large herds are thus sometimes \nescorted by armed herders equipped with modern \ncommunication equipment. They move across areas \nconsidered to be virtual \u201cgray zones\u201d but which also \nhost certain emblematic protected areas. \n1.3.3 The impact of trade \nand\u00a0socioeconomic inequality\nAs for all of Africa, globalization has strongly \naffected pastoralist communities. As a result, pastoral \npractices, such as transhumance, have changed \nsubstantially over the last 30 years. The development \nof urban markets and access to basic services, and the \nimprovement of communication technologies, have \nopened the door to new opportunities. Since the \n1990s, the flows of cattle from Chad and northern \nCameroon to major urban markets have grown \nsteadily. Herds most often head towards Nigeria. \nThe prices of animals are generally set according \nto the terms of trade with agricultural products. \n\u00ad\nPastoralists have long benefited from relatively stable \nterms of trade favorable to their activity. Today, specu\u00ad\nlation, price volatility and the substitution of local \nproducts by imported products are causing price \ninstability. Depending on the geographic area, the \nprice relationship between livestock products and \nagricultural products has even changed to the detri-\nment of pastoralists. Pastoralists must sell more to \ngenerate the same amount of income that they earned \npreviously. For some pastoralists, the size of their \nhousehold\u2019s herd is decreasing at the very moment \nthat they should have more animals to ensure the \nsurvival of their family units in the medium term.\nIn both Chad and Cameroon, a gradual transfer of \nlivestock is taking place, from the smallest and poorest \npastoralists to the wealthiest ones. Rich transhumant \npastoralists benefit from the protection of national \neconomic and political environments thanks to their \nlucrative activities.

The State is indeed \nthe primary actor in promoting the governance of \nprotected areas. In addition to dedicated ministries \nand specialized government agencies (such as the \nInstitut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature \n- ICCN, in DRC), various other ministries (agricul-\nture, animal resources, mining, defense and security, \neducation) may collaborate \u2013\u202for not\u202f\u2013 on biodiver-\nsity conservation.\nAt a more local level, the regions, departments, \nurban and rural municipalities, conservation services \nof protected areas and declared hunting areas can be \ninvolved in governance, along with the ministries in \ncharge of the environment, water and forests and any \nother sectoral administration concerned.

They also ensure the application of \ngovernance principles and the respect of international \ncommitments made by governments. It should also \nbe noted that, they are increasingly involved in the \npreparation of international documents.\nIn terms of the private sector\u2019s role, this is mani-\nfested by the presence of private operators, such \nas hunting or fishing concessionaires, managers \nof tourism infrastructure and other authorized \neconomic activities, etc. Thanks to their ability to \nmobilize financial resources, they ensure the oper-\nation and long-term maintenance of associated \neconomic activities. \nThe plurality of actors generally means a plurality \nof \u201crepresentational configurations\u201d and we can \ntherefore see the emergence of power games and \ninfluence peddling within governance. In practical \nterms, the outcomes of governance systems are \nclosely linked to the skills of the members of the \nmanagement team, who are responsible for adapting \na formal framework to a local context that has its \nown rules, in order to achieve the management \nobjectives of the protected area.\n\nDocument 195: Special support in \nterms of the sustainable development of the protected \narea\u2019s biodiversity also is needed, whether this involve \necotourism (see Chapter\u202f8), the development of \necosystem services (carbon, watershed protection) \nor the use of certain natural resources (when this is \ntolerated). In too many cases, communities are being \nled to believe that they can expect benefits from the \nestablishment of protected areas, but they are not \nbeing provided with the means or support to realize \nthese expectations.\nThese obstacles can only be overcome with \nmedium to long-term institutionalized support \nfrom the State and development partners (planning, \norganization, legal recognition, law enforcement, \ninformation and training, etc.). Governance and \nlocal development projects cannot be considered \nwithout a link to national planning for sustainable \ndevelopment and land use, nor without support from \nnational structures.

In Central Africa, \nland is generally collectively owned, and it is the \nState\u2019s responsibility to delegate governance. These \nprivate actors may include individuals or conser-\nvation NGOs, who purchase and privatize land for \nnatural resource conservation. These actors also may \nhave financial interests in these protected areas. They \ncan effectively develop ecotourism activities but \nalso benefit from taxes and fees related to their land \n(Fouth et al, 2017). \nIn the subregion, the only protected area under \nprivate governance is Lekedi Park (see section 4.1), \nbut small areas also may be linked to this form of \ngovernance, such as arboretums created by private \ninitiatives (in Burundi, for example).\n\nDocument 89: 38\n3. Continually evolving legislation \nGovernments have a range of tools at their disposal \nto combat biodiversity loss. All Central African coun-\ntries have ratified various international agreements \nand conventions that provide a general framework \nfor actions and policies promoting better coexistence \nbetween humanity and the rest of the living world. \nHowever, it is national legislation that has the force \nof law above all else. Moreover, to be effective, such \nlegislation must be enforced by all stakeholders, not \njust protected area managers.\nSince 2015 and the first State of Protected Areas \n(Doumenge et al., 2015a), a number of new pieces \nof legislation have been enacted or revised. This \nis the case, for example, of the law of 8 July 2020 \nconcerning the forestry code in Congo, which intro-\nduced the notion of \u201cecological damage\u201d that the \nState is likely to suffer as a result of actions against \nforest ecosystems. One of the changes observed in \nforest management also concerns conservation forest \nconcessions, which DRC has set up (see box). This \ntype of concession can complement the network of \nprotected areas in the subregion (see section 1.3), \nprovided that the laws and regulations are respected \nand that the objectives and management of these \nconcessions allow for effective biodiversity \u00ad\nprotection \n(which may not always be the case; Wabiwa Betoko \n& de Hoog, 2021). However, this offers new opportu-\nnities for biodiversity protection and raises questions \nabout the inclusion of this type of land use in the \nglobal database of protected areas.\nThe level of protection provided for in the texts \nvaries greatly according to the type of ecosystems and \nthreats identified on the wild fauna and flora. Since \n2017, a decree designates ICCN as the manage-\nment body of the Convention on International Trade \nin Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora \n(CITES) in DRC.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":167,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

For flora, it is projected that 20 to 30% of plant species will face a greater risk of extinction if global warming exceeds 1.5\u00b0C to 2.5\u00b0C. This is due to loss of suitable habitats and a rise in temperatures which affects the reproduction of many tree species. In terms of fauna, climate change, along with intensifying pressures from human activities, is causing the decline of biodiversity in protected areas. Changes are already noticeable in the geographic distribution of diverse terrestrial and aquatic organisms in response to global warming. Moreover, the populations of various species in Central Africa could decline sharply under the impact of extreme climate events.

Knowledge of past changes \nin the climate and their effects on ecosystems has \nhelped identify former forest refuge areas that could \nprefigure, at least to some extent, future forest refuges \n(Maley et al., 2018). An understanding of these refuge \nareas is essential for preparing adaptation strategies \nand establishing effective protected area networks. \nIn the very short term, some studies carried out \nin Lope National Park (Gabon) have found that the \nfruiting of certain plant species has already begun to \nplummet (Bush et al., 2020). The reproduction of many \ntree species depends on a slight drop in temperature \nduring the dry season, one which no longer occurs \nwhen temperatures rise (Tutin & Fernandez, 1993). As \ndiscussed above, this in turn affects animal populations. \nThis increase in temperature is therefore likely to lead \nto the depletion or even the eventual disappearance of \nthese plant species due to reproductive collapse. \nMoreover, drought also leads to a general \nincrease in tree mortality, especially of larger trees \nand those with low density wood; this is already \nthe case in the Amazon and Southeast Asia (Phil-\nlips et al., 2010).\n\nDocument 889: In the very short term, some studies carried out \nin Lope National Park (Gabon) have found that the \nfruiting of certain plant species has already begun to \nplummet (Bush et al., 2020). The reproduction of many \ntree species depends on a slight drop in temperature \nduring the dry season, one which no longer occurs \nwhen temperatures rise (Tutin & Fernandez, 1993). As \ndiscussed above, this in turn affects animal populations. \nThis increase in temperature is therefore likely to lead \nto the depletion or even the eventual disappearance of \nthese plant species due to reproductive collapse. \nMoreover, drought also leads to a general \nincrease in tree mortality, especially of larger trees \nand those with low density wood; this is already \nthe case in the Amazon and Southeast Asia (Phil-\nlips et al., 2010). More droughts favors the selection \nof the most drought-resistant species and induces \nchanges in vegetation. This was demonstrated in a \nstudy conducted in Ghana in dense tropical forests \nfollowing two decades of a drier climate (Fauset \net al., 2012). The authors found an increase in canopy, \ndeciduous, intermediate light demanding, dry forest \nspecies (often very widespread), and a decrease in \nsub-canopy, shade-tolerant, evergreen species (often \nrarer and more localized). A similar, albeit less \npronounced, phenomenon has been observed in the \nAmazon in most of the sites studied there (Esquiv-\nel-Muelbert et al., 2019). \nWoody forage vegetation in landscapes used by \nlivestock farmers would also be more vulnerable \ndue to the strong pressures this vegetation is already \nexperiencing (Nyasimi et al., 2015; Zakari et al., \n2017). Across most of Africa, this vegetation is now \ngenerally decreasing due to the constant decline \nin rainfall since the 1960s, an expansion of land \nunder cultivation, livestock farming systems which \noften lead to the overexploitation of this resource \nand a rapidly increasing urban demand for wood \n(Onana & Devineau, 2002).\n\nDocument 887: 365\n365\ncarried out in Lope National Park in Gabon have \nrevealed a drastic drop of around 80% in the fruit \nproduction of plant species consumed by elephants \nbetween 1986 and 2018, and a decline of over 10% \nin the body condition of fruit-dependent elephants \nsince 2008 (Bush et al., 2020).  \nThese in-depth studies concerning current and \nfuture changes in ecosystems and biodiversity are \ninvaluable, but they remain rare and piecemeal. \nCertain models can partially compensate for these \nshortcomings, and seem to indicate that the Congo \nBasin could become unsuitable for mammals in \nthe long term while the Atlantic side of Central \nAfrica could prove to be an important refuge for \nmammalian biodiversity at the level of Africa \n(Thuiller et al., 2006).  \nThe effects of extreme temperatures on wild-\nlife species highlight the complex ramifications of \nclimate change on the behavior, demographics and \nsurvival of species. The physiological \u00ad\nmechanisms \nunderlying thermal tolerance limits and the capacity \nto adapt to these limits thus need to be better \nunderstood to predict the direct impact of global \nwarming on wildlife diversity. This remains an area \nof research to be developed in the protected areas \nof Central Africa.\n2.3 Vulnerability of flora \nClimate change is now recognized as one of the \nmajor threats to the integrity of ecosystems around \nthe world. In particular, climate change will affect \nbiological diversity and the geographical distribution \nof habitats favorable to species, including useful and \ncultivated plant species (Parry et al., 2007; Fandohan \net al., 2013; Eba Eba\u2019a Atyi et al., 2015a). Knowledge \nof the specific characteristics of the changes likely to \nimpact species or their habitats is a key element in adap-\ntation strategies (Heller & Zavaleta, 2009; Fandohan \net al., 2013). Climate change is an \u00ad\nenvironmental issue\n\nDocument 886: 2.2 Vulnerability of fauna \nThe vulnerability of wildlife to climate change, \nalong with intensifying pressures from human \nactivities, is causing the decline of biodiversity in \nprotected areas. With changes already noticeable in \nthe geographic distribution of diverse terrestrial and \naquatic organisms in response to global warming, \nlittle information exists on the direct links between \ninnate characteristics (including physiological traits, \nphysiological tolerance limits and genetic diversity) \nand the vulnerability of species to climate change \n(Root et al., 2003; Calosi et al.; 2008; Williams et al., \n2008; Pacoureau, 2018). \nOver the past 100\u202fyears, the global average temper-\nature has increased by approximately 0.714\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.18\u2009\u00b0C, \nand it is expected to continue to rise at a rapid rate \n(Pachauri & Reisinger, 2008; Welbergen et al., 2008). \nDuring periods of rapid climate change, taxa which \nare unable to change their geographic range are at \nparticular risk of extinction, especially if they cannot \nphysiologically compensate for variations in the envi-\nronment (Bradshaw & Holzapfel, 2001; Davis & \nShaw, 2001; Balany\u00e1 et al., 2006).\nAlthough they may not disappear immediately, \nthe populations of various species in Central Africa \ncould decline sharply under the impact of extreme \nclimate events. For example, sedentary antelopes \nand elephants could be sensitive to severe droughts \n(Maron et al., 2015). Climate change will also alter \nthe flowering and fruiting capacity of vegetation, \nwith cascading effects on all of the species which \ndepend on it (Butt et al., 2015). This seems to be the \ncase for forest elephants, whose health already has \nbeen impacted by a significant decrease in the plant \nspecies which they consume.

Protected areas \nare now the backbone of policies and strategies for \nbiodiversity conservation and sustainable manage-\nment. Over the past decade, the global protected area \nnetwork has increased steadily, both on land and at \nsea, including in Central Africa (Doumenge et al., \n2015a; UNEP-WCMC, 2018). This increase has \nhelped mitigate the effects of climate change and \nthe accelerating rate of species extinction (WWF, \n2020; IPBES, 2019).\nSome progress has been made in the implementa-\ntion of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, \nbut it remains insufficient (CDB, 2020). Protected \nareas will be at the heart of the negotiations of the \nnew post-2020 global biodiversity framework to be \ndiscussed at the 15th Conference of the Parties of the \nConvention on Biological Diversity (COP15-CBD). \nOne of the key measures is to protect at least 30% \nof the world\u2019s land and marine areas, with at least \n10% under so-called \u201cstrict\u201d protection (CDB, 2019). \nHow can Central African protected areas contribute \nto this new global dynamic of biodiversity protec-\ntion and preservation of ecological balances? And \nhow are protected area managers in the subregion \nresponding to some of the challenges facing them? \nThis Chapter\u202fattempts to answer this twofold ques-\ntion; other more detailed answers also are provided in \nthe thematic chapters of this book.  \n1.\n\nDocument 36: Central Africa for the most part \nescaped the massive fires that ravaged the Amazon, Southeast Asia and Australia in 2019-\n2020, but this may not be the case in the future. The subregion has not been spared from \nglobal warming. Savannas and dry forests already have been weakened and attacked by fires, \nand pasturelands are no longer green, leaving animals hungry. Livestock farmers are forced to \nventure into protected areas for water and fresh grass for their herds. \nEcosystems in the countries of Central Africa are becoming increasingly degraded due to \nintensifying anthropogenic pressures driven in particular by population growth and demand \nfrom international markets. Natural ecosystems are exposed to wildlife poaching, an expansion \nof transhumant pastoralism, an increase in mining permits, industrial agriculture and family \nfarming, the exploitation of wood (timber, fuel wood), conflicts over land, and the list goes on.\nIn this constantly changing context, where international and local challenges are closely \nintertwined, protected areas are one of the most effective management tools for slowing \nbiodiversity loss, mitigating the impact of climate change, and helping ecosystems and human \ncommunities adapt to change. Some countries have already understood this and have devel-\noped land-use plans that include national protected area networks capable of playing this \ntriple ecological, social and economic role that is the backbone of sustainable development. \nState of Protected Areas in Central Africa 2020 illustrates the subregion\u2019s contribution to safe-\nguarding the quality of life of current and future generations.

The country also has \nput in place a specific pricing policy for visiting the \nparks for nationals but also for African nationals, \nin particular those from the EAC (Visit Rwanda, \n2021st). This program, called Tembera U Rwanda, \nhas been in place since 2015 and is widely adver-\ntised (\u00ad\nNtirenganya, 2017; RDB, 2020). In 2018, over \n44,000\u202ftourists visited Akagera Park, half of whom \nwere Rwandan nationals (NPC, 2021b).\n\nDocument 808: 333\nFigure\u202f4 - Tourism attendance and revenue in Zakouma National Park (Chad) in 2018\n67.5\n14.6\n13.2\n4.7\nTotal: 3,890 visitors\n\u25a0 Educational tours  \u25a0 Nationals  \u25a0 Foreign residents  \u25a0 Internationals\n0.0\n3.9\n23.4\n72.7\nTotal: 767,382 $US\na) Types of visitors (%)\nb) Revenue by type of visitor (%)\nSource: APN (2018).\nA study conducted in Cameroon a few years ago \nalready noted this phenomenon (Nlom et al., 2013). \nAt that time, Waza National Park was the protected \narea receiving the highest number of tourists (Table\u202f7). \nEven so, the number of visitors traveling across \nthe entire country to Waza was 2.3 times less than \nthose traveling to Mefou Wildlife Park, 45\u2009km from \nYaounde. And if these figures are compared with visits \nto the zoo-botanical gardens of Limbe (70\u2009km from \nDouala) or Yaounde (Mvog-Betsi), the differences \nare even more important. These two semi-natural \nurban spaces see several tens of thousands of visitors \nper year: over 110,000 visitors, mainly Cameroonian, \nvisited these two gardens in 2012; foreign visitors \n(residents and internationals) are few, although they \nconstitute the majority of tourists visiting protected \nareas (Table\u202f7). The case of Mefou Park is interesting \nbecause it is a wildlife park (with primates) located \nin a forest that could be classified as a protected area; \n30% of its visitors are \u201cnational\u201d, including resident \nforeigners but also Cameroonians. \nIf only entrance fees are considered, the gardens of \nMvog-Betsi and Limbe and Mefou parks were gener-\nating far more revenue than all of the protected areas at \nthat time (approximately US$170,000 vs. US$65,000; \nFigure\u202f5).\n\nDocument 800: Often, only a small number of protected \nareas can be or are visited.

People are unable to successfully farm without an effective method of protecting \ntheir fields. Previous attempts at mitigation included cable fences with chili grease, burning \nchili bricks, beehive fences, and night guarding with a gun (to fire in the air), all with limited \nsuccess and lack continued use by the community (Madzou, 1999; Ongognongo, 2006; Nsonsi, \nn.d.). \u00a0Following the successful implementation of two solar-powered electric fences to protect \nresearch camps in PNNN against persistent elephant raids, WCS piloted a 4-ha community \nagriculture project to evaluate the potential benefits of this system to prevent crop-raiding by \nelephants. The fence was installed in June 2019. The design includes 85\u2009\ncm-long flexible elec-\ntrified barbs. These barbs aim to prevent elephants from touching the trees or breaking the \nwire with their non-conductive tusks.

In 1997 it was reduced \nin size by close to 50% to provide land for refugees. Unfortunately, wildlife such as buffaloes, \nelephants, hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius), wild pigs and baboons (Papio sp.) were raiding \ncrops and farmers had problems holding them down.\nSolution\nIn 2013, the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) inaugurated an electric fence to reduce \nhuman-wildlife conflict in the area and to bring to an end life, crop and livestock losses due to \nanimals straying from the park.\n\nDocument 435: An electric fence is \nno solution when financial means are lacking, and \nbee-fencing cannot be applied when local resistance \nagainst bees exists. Finally, any co-existence approach \nneeds to respect the existing cultural relationships of \npeople and elephants. We must include knowledge \nabout the ethnobiology of a site to increase toler-\nance towards conflict species (Setchell et al., 2017; \nParathian et al., 2018).\nConservation organizations jointly working with \ngovernmental offices in Central Africa can play a \ncrucial role in the implementation of human-\u00ad\nwildlife \nconflict projects.  They often have the knowledge and \nstaff capacity needed, and can raise funds to cover \nsalaries of full-time employment for experts and the \nrelevant operational budget and logistics. Given the \nwide-ranging nature of elephants, it will be impor-\ntant to collaborate with other stakeholders (logging \nand safari companies, and mining extractives) in \nthe buffer zones of protected areas.

Ngama, IRAF-CENAREST\nContext\nThe use of beehives to protect plantations has successfully reduced elephant damage on crops \nin many savanna areas throughout Africa (King et al., 2009, 2011, 2017; Goodier & King, 2017; \nBranco et al., 2019; Scheijen et al., 2019). Beekeeping has the additional advantage of producing \nhoney, potentially diversifying and increasing the livelihoods of local farmers. While promising, \nthis method needs further research because no comparable work has been conducted on forest \nelephants or with Apis mellifera adansonii, the only species of African honey bee in Central \nAfrica. The trials presented here had two objectives: (1) experimentally examining whether the \npresence of the African honey bee species present in Central Africa deters forest elephants \nfrom feeding on fruit trees; (2) assessing whether local communities could adopt the strategy \non using beehives to both protect their crops and enhance their livelihoods (Ngama et al., 2016).\nMethods and results\nWe conducted trials with local people to adopt modern beekeeping around Monts de \nCristal National Park and in the Gamba Complex. Ten villages were involved, and residents \nwere sensitized on the importance of bees and modern beekeeping. Technical, financial and \nhuman limitations were considered by setting trials according to available resources. Thus, \nfruit trees were used to set beehives (two beehives per tree) instead of plantations which \nwould require more material (about hundred beehives per site). The trial involved govern-\nmental agencies (IRAF-CENAREST, ANPN), local companies (Colas-Gabon, Shell-Gabon) and \nnon-governmental actors (WCS, Smithsonian Institution).\nThe trials did not allow a direct assessment of human-elephant conflict. Yet about 150 people \nwere trained on beekeeping with twenty of them receiving beekeeping equipment in Monts \nde Cristal National Park. Most of the people trained adopted modern beekeeping.\n\nDocument 466: Please \nnote that other wildlife might raid crops during other \nperiods of the crop growth cycle.\nRecently, the application of mitigation \u00ad\nmeasures, \nparticularly the use of bees and chili to deter elephants, \nhas been conducted in Gabon on fruiting trees. When \ntesting the use of beehives, even though elephants \ncould adjust their feeding strategies to overcome the \nbee threat by feeding at night, bees have been found \nable to recruit more fighters and grow their colonies. \nThe ability of bees to defend hives from elephants \ndepends on multiple environmental factors. For \nthat, farmers need to manage their beehives to reach \nan optimum level enabling bees to effectively deter \nelephants and produce honey. This includes protecting \nbeehives against predators, \u00ad\nwhich is not an easy task. \nA Human-Wildlife Conflict Mitigation Toolkit for Central Africa\nS. Ngama, IRAF-CENAREST and T. Breuer, WWF Germany\nContent of the toolkit\nBased on the lack of information on methods to mitigate human-wildlife conflict in Central \nAfrica and the need of the Commission des For\u00eats d\u2019Afrique Centrale (COMIFAC) and the \nR\u00e9seau des Aires Prot\u00e9g\u00e9es d\u2019Afrique Centrale (RAPAC) to provide tools to conservation prac-\ntitioners, a Human-Wildlife Conflict Mitigation Toolkit (FAO et al., 2014) has been developed by \nFAO, CIRAD, Awely and various partners (Le Bel et al., 2016; Nguinguiri et al., 2017). The toolkit \nis a device which includes five documents gathered in a canvas bag:\n\u2013\t1. A Wildlife Book presenting the 17 animal taxa occurring in Central Africa that come in \nconflict with people;\n\u2013\t2.

Using beehives \nwill benefit both humans and elephant conservation \nif properly managed and maintained.\nAs a biological strategy, the use of beehives \npresents many challenges including: i)\u202fparasites \nand diseases which diminish honey production and \ncould also have a negative effect on the efficiency of \nbeehives as elephant deterrents; ii)\u202fbee stings which \ncould discourage people from practicing beekeeping; \niii)\u202fthe inability to \u00ad\nmaintain beehives at the optimum \nactivity level could lead to a failure of the hive to deter \nelephants. Given these challenges, people must master \nbeekeeping and be properly trained to successfully use \nbeehives, and more research is necessary to test the \nability of hives to deter elephants in plantations.\nUse of chili pepper to mitigate human-elephant conflict in the Gamba \nComplex, Southeast Gabon\nS. Ngama, IRAF-CENAREST\nProblem statement\nTo prevent elephant damage on crops, the use of chili is promoted under different forms \n(unpalatable crop, burning bricks, chili guns, chili bombs, chili bullets, etc.) as a non-lethal \nmethod. As the Gamba complex, in Southeast Gabon, is one of the human-elephant conflict \nhotspots, low tech devices using chili to keep elephants away from fruiting mango trees were \ntested. In this experiment, we were particularly interested to understand how forest elephants \nreact to devices using chili pepper as a deterrent based on sequential camera trap photos \n(Ngama et al., 2018).","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":523,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

Climate change has been particularly \noverlooked, as it seems that the fruiting of natural \nforest trees seems to have fallen dramatically during \nthe past 30 years, which may have pushed elephants \n\u201cout of the wood\u201d (Bush et al., 2020).\n\nDocument 438: It is a misconception that more signs of \nhuman-elephant conflict are due to an increasing \nforest elephant population resulting from successful \nlaw enforcement activities as forest elephants show \nslow population recovery (Turkalo et al., 2017). \nConflict between elephants and people arises due to \nthe expansion of human settlements and slash-and-\nburn agriculturel, which are encroaching on elephant \nhabitats, and to elephants moving to areas where \nthey feel safe. Increasing habitat loss and fragmen-\ntation due to development of linear infrastructure, \n\u00ad\nexpansion of human settlements and people\u2019s need for \nland, agriculture and pastures are resulting in a serious \nincrease in human-wildlife conflict zones throughout \nthe continent (Kleinschroth et al., 2019).\nPoaching has worsened the situation on various \nlevels. For example, conflicts are exacerbated due to the \nphenomenon of compression into protected areas and \nthe loss of fear of humans due to local high levels of \nprotection, and the attraction of elephants to secondary \nforest with its dense understory (Nchanji & Lawson, \n1998; Naughton et al., 1999; \u00ad\nNaughton-Treves & \nTreves, 2005; Breuer et al., 2016). Given the anthro-\npogenic impacts on forest elephants, the killing of \nlarger older tuskers with the resulting loss of ecolog-\nical knowledge, heightened aggression and increased \nexploratory behavior of younger males combined with \nincreased compression and fragmentation, it is very \nlikely that human-elephant conflict is going to severely \nincrease in the future, despite an overall decline \nin forest elephant numbers (Breuer\u00a0et al.,\u00a02016). \nThis\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0\u00ad\nexaggerated by the deteriorating social \ncontext (e.g., increased poverty, civil and political \ninstability, worsened governmental support, rapid \npopulation growth and land needs, but also rural \nexodus, etc.) in some Central African countries (e.g., \nsocial vulnerability). If local people feel that they are \nleft alone to face these problems, a transformation \nfrom conflict to co-existence is unlikely to happen.\n\nDocument 437: 185\ninvestigate conflicts between people, even though the \nconflict with wildlife might often be a surrogate for a \n\u00ad\ndeeper-rooted social conflict.\nProblems can be very site specific and depend on \nthe socio-cultural context of the stakeholders as well \nas the ecological setting in the landscapes or around \nthe concerned protected area. Furthermore, it is \nimportant to understand whether the human-ele-\nphant conflict concerns a larger portion of the human \nand elephant populations or just a few problem \nelephants or concerned farmers. Thus, understanding \nsusceptibility to and determinants of human-\u00ad\nelephant conflict requires a deeper \u00ad\nknowledge of \nsite-specific conflict patterns, especially crop raiding, \nwhich is likely to change over time as elephants \nquickly adapt to new situations. There are various \ndimensions of vulnerability, including biophysical, \nsocial and institutional components, and investi-\ngating these components together is likely to reveal \na much better understanding than \u00ad\ninvestigating a \nsingle factor on its own.\nIt is important to know that forest elephants have \nalways been present in these landscapes. They have \nnot been re-introduced, nor have they been forced \nout of protected areas due to growth in the elephant \npopulation. It is a misconception that more signs of \nhuman-elephant conflict are due to an increasing \nforest elephant population resulting from successful \nlaw enforcement activities as forest elephants show \nslow population recovery (Turkalo et al., 2017). \nConflict between elephants and people arises due to \nthe expansion of human settlements and slash-and-\nburn agriculturel, which are encroaching on elephant \nhabitats, and to elephants moving to areas where \nthey feel safe.

In countries \nwhere public opinion is very sensitive to the transfer \nof responsibilities from the public to the private \nsector, even conditionally, the State will always prefer \na co-management agreement regardless of whether in \npractice all operational management operations of the \nprotected area are carried out by the private partner.\n2. Public-private partnership \ninitiatives in Central Africa\n2.1 Background\nAfrican Parks Network pioneered the implementa-\ntion of delegated management partnerships in Africa \nand holds the largest number of contracts with govern-\nments of the subregion (6\/13\u202fcontracts currently and \nsoon 7\/14 with Nyungwe) (see Figure\u202f1). This organ-\nization has established medium-term partnerships in \nDRC and Chad, and long-term partnerships in CAR, \nRwanda and Congo.\nWildlife Conservation Society is an international \nNGO that has been engaged in the management \nof Central African protected areas since the end of \nthe 1980s. In 2013, it started working under a PPP \nin Nouabale-Ndoki (Congo), a park in which it has \nbeen providing technical assistance since 1993. WCS \nhas signed two new contracts: i) in 2018 in CAR \n(protected areas in the north), where its presence is \nnew; and ii) in 2019 in DRC for the wildlife reserve \nin Okapis where it has been present for many years.  \nWorld Wide Fund for Nature, a conservation \nNGO, has long dominated the Central African \nconservation landscape.\n\nDocument 252: 106\n106\nThe efficiency of this type of partnership has \nbeen the main reason for the model\u2019s application to \nprotected areas which have been underfunded and \ndeprived of investments for a long time. However, \nthe PPPs currently in place in Central Africa are all \nnot-for-profit. Any revenue from the partnership is \nfirst invested in the protected area before being used \nto potentially provide support to communities on the \noutskirts of the protected area or the public partner \n(case of DRC).\nThis management mode requires more in-depth \npreparation and planning than conventional manage-\nment modes, and the appropriate management of the \nprocurement stage. This approach makes it possible to \nstimulate competition between candidates. However, \nthe use of competitive procedures is not yet common \nin PPPs applied to Central African protected areas. \nIndeed, all PPPs currently in place were concluded \nthrough single source negotiation processes and not \ncalls for tenders.\nExamples include the case of APN for Akagera \nNational Park in Rwanda, Zakouma National Park \nin Chad, Chinko Nature Reserve in CAR, Garamba \nNational Park in DRC, and Odzala National Park \nin Congo (Figure\u202f1). At present, two contracts are \nbeing prepared following a call for tenders, Nyungwe \nNational Park (in Rwanda) with APN and Conk-\nouati-Douli National Park (in Congo) with No\u00e9 \n(a\u00a0French NGO registered in Congo). Unfortunately, \ntheir contract negotiations were delayed due to the \nCovid-19 pandemic.\n1.4 Public-private partnership, \ndelegated management \nor\u00a0co-management? \nStudies focussing on public-private partnerships \nfor the management of protected areas often seek \nto establish a typology based on different criteria \n(governance arrangements, operational management, \nfinancing, etc.). The terms \u201cdelegated management\u201d \nand \u201cco-management\u201d thus appear often to distin-\nguish the degree of collaboration between the two \npartners. Co-management is supposed to represent a \nmodel where responsibility is more balanced between \nthe two partners. In practice, it has proven difficult to \nmake a distinction between these two models. \nBaghai et al.\n\nDocument 254: 107\n107\nco-\u00ad\n\u00ad\nmanagement model, the sharing of authority is \nmore balanced and the State retains its sovereign \nmissions: anti-poaching operations are directed by \nthe public authority which has the power to hire and \ndismiss its agents, while the partner can do the same \nwith its own contract staff.\nOn the basis of these two definitions, the afore-\nmentioned authors consider that the protected areas \nof Virunga and Salonga in DRC, and Dzanga-Sangha \nin CAR, fall under co-management, while the \nprotected areas of Akagera and Nyungwe (Rwanda), \nGaramba (DRC), Chinko (CAR), Zakouma (Chad), \nNouabale-Ndoki and Odzala-Kokoua (Congo) fall \nunder delegated management. Yet when the part-\nnership agreements are examined in detail, this \ncategorization no longer appears clear. While it is \ntrue that in Salonga and Virunga those responsible \nfor combatting poaching are appointed by the public \nauthority, this is also the case in Garamba (under \ndelegated management), but is not the case in Dzan-\nga-Sangha (nonetheless also under co-management), \nAkagera or Nyungwe. In terms of the composition \nof governance entities, the criterion of having the \nmajority of representatives appointed by the private \npartner for delegated management mode appears \nto be verified overall; however, this is also the case \nfor Dzanga-Sangha, which is nevertheless under \nco-management. \nOverall, in the co-management model, the public \npartner is more present and the key positions of oper-\national management fall within the public authority\u2019s \ndomain, in particular police operations, for which it is \nresponsible under the law. In fact, there is a gradient \nbetween co-management and delegated manage-\nment regarding the transfer of responsibility from \nthe public partner to the private partner which can \ntake several forms. As a result, it is not always easy to \nassign a protected area to a particular model, as was \nrecognized by Baghai et al. (2018).\nThe \u201cco-management\u201d versus \u201cdelegated manage-\nment\u201d debate is not just a semantic one.\n\nDocument 241: Partnerships with private organizations have been \nsuggested to be a means to address the root causes, \ni.e., \u201cpoor incentives\u201d and \u201cunderfunding\u201d, as not-for-\nprofit organizations generally are distinguished by \ntheir technical expertise and credibility in the eyes \nof international funding agencies compared to often \nhighly centralized bureaucratic governmental organ-\nizations (Hatchwell, 2014; Saporiti, 2006; Baghai \net\u00a0 al., 2018; Scholte et al., 2018). Since the early \n2000s, protected area authorities in some 12 countries \nin sub-Saharan Africa have delegated park manage-\nment to international non-governmental private \npartners. While Malawi and Zambia led the way in \nSouthern Africa to adopt such partnerships, Central \nAfrican countries hesitated to embrace delegated \nmanagement to help restore their parks. Delegated \nmanagement has long been perceived as \u201callowing \nforeigners to take over our national parks\u201d. Doubts \nabout its feasibility and desirability continues to \nreign amongst protected areas authorities in Central \nAfrican countries, such as Cameroon and Gabon. \nIn 2005, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n(DRC) took the lead in Central Africa, contracting \nAfrican Parks Network (APN) for the management \nof Garamba National Park and Virunga Foun-\ndation for the management of Virunga National \nPark. Since 2010, the DRC has been joined by an \nincreasing number of Central African countries, \nsuch as Chad, Rwanda, Congo and Central African \nRepublic (CAR), which have initiated Public-\u00ad\nPrivate \nPartnerships (PPP) (Figure\u202f1). As of July 2020, \n13 partnerships have been contracted (the 14th at \nNyungwe National Park in Rwanda is imminent), \nmanaging a total area of c. 205,000\u2009km2, the size of \nSenegal. The presently concluded contracts will allow, \npending further studies and developments, this area \nto increase to c. 306,000\u2009km2.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":255,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

In October \n2017, actors involved in the management of Deng \nDeng National Park (created as an offset of a hydro-\nelectric scheme), in close collaboration with the \nhydroelectric company, organized a national meeting \nto keep Cameroonian authorities informed about \nexperiences with delegated management.\nIn December 2017, the Sub-working group \non protected areas and wildlife (SGAPFS) of \nCOMIFAC took the initiative to develop \u201cBest prac-\ntices for the management of protected areas through \npublic-private partnerships in Central Africa\u201d. This \nprocess incorporated two workshops (December 2017 \nin Libreville, and April 2018 in Douala) resulting in \nguidelines that were further developed, published and \nadopted by COMIFAC\u2019s Board of Ministers in July \n2019 (COMIFAC, 2018).\nAlongside these initiatives, we collected details \non Central African protected areas partnerships, \ncompiled external evaluations from the partnerships \nand tried to draw further lessons.

This may be understandable \nwhere private partners have initiated conserva-\ntion activities in the area, as is the case with WWF \nin Dzangha-Sangha protected area (CAR) and \nWCS in Nouabale-Ndoki National Park (Congo). \nHowever, we wonder if this should automatically \ncontinue as partnerships mature and protected areas \nbecome more developed. In this respect, Garamba \nNational Park is an example where its first delegated \nmanagement contract in 2005 totalled seven pages, \nwhich tripled to 24 in 2016, with increased expecta-\ntions within the DRC.\nSome other types of partnerships may also be \nconsidered, depending on responsibilities handled to \nthe private partner or economic activity considered \n(Table\u202f5). These other types of contracts and economic \nmodels (Roulet, 2004 or Yasuda, 2012 on sport \nhunting, for example) will not be detailed here but \nthey might offer other opportunities for conservation \nthrough economic activities, which differ substantially \nfrom non-profit PPPs discussed in this chapter.    \nDeng Deng National Park in Cameroon:  \ntowards a new type of funding mechanism\nDeng Deng National Park in Cameroon was established in 2010 on 6,820\u2009\nkm2. Its crea-\ntion was part of the environmental compensation for the construction of Lom Pangar \ndam, which destroyed approximately 6,000\u2009\nkm2 of dense rainforest. This park is home \nto a wide range of wildlife, notably the northernmost population of lowland gorillas. \nIt has received material support, in particular from \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Cameroun (EDC), a \npublic hydro-electric company responsible for the dam. It also has received technical \nimplementation assistance from WCS (2008-2012), followed by the BRLi-SFAB consul-\ntancy firm (2014-2018) with funding from the French Development Agency (AFD).","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":245,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

If the management team of the park in question \ncontinues to take actions to achieve objectives defined on the basis of an inventory made over \n20 years ago, there is a strong risk that it will be out of step with the current situation of the \nprotected area, which will call into question the effectiveness of the actions undertaken.\n\nDocument 395: METT\n(Management \nEffectiveness \nTracking Tool)\nhttps:\/\n\/rris.biopama.\norg\/node\/18647\nA tool for measuring the performance of \na protected area in relation to community \ndevelopment actions, METT allows for \na rapid assessment of the effectiveness \nof a protected area\u2019s management. \nThe different versions of METT allow \nmanagers and their partners to identify \nneeds, constraints, trends, strengths, \nweaknesses and priority actions to \nimprove the management effectiveness \nof a protected area.

These \ndiscussions figured prominently at the annually held \nCoCo-Congo (Community Conservation Congo) \nconference in 2013-2015, where the Institut Congo-\nlais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN), the \nprotected areas authority, met up with its partners to \ndiscuss ongoing topics.\nIn 2014, regional discussions were initiated by \nthe Network of Central African Protected Areas \n(RAPAC) in Douala, Cameroon.

Since the early \n2000s, protected area authorities in some 12 countries \nin sub-Saharan Africa have delegated park manage-\nment to international non-governmental private \npartners. While Malawi and Zambia led the way in \nSouthern Africa to adopt such partnerships, Central \nAfrican countries hesitated to embrace delegated \nmanagement to help restore their parks. Delegated \nmanagement has long been perceived as \u201callowing \nforeigners to take over our national parks\u201d. Doubts \nabout its feasibility and desirability continues to \nreign amongst protected areas authorities in Central \nAfrican countries, such as Cameroon and Gabon. \nIn 2005, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n(DRC) took the lead in Central Africa, contracting \nAfrican Parks Network (APN) for the management \nof Garamba National Park and Virunga Foun-\ndation for the management of Virunga National \nPark. Since 2010, the DRC has been joined by an \nincreasing number of Central African countries, \nsuch as Chad, Rwanda, Congo and Central African \nRepublic (CAR), which have initiated Public-\u00ad\nPrivate \nPartnerships (PPP) (Figure\u202f1).

In October \n2017, actors involved in the management of Deng \nDeng National Park (created as an offset of a hydro-\nelectric scheme), in close collaboration with the \nhydroelectric company, organized a national meeting \nto keep Cameroonian authorities informed about \nexperiences with delegated management.\nIn December 2017, the Sub-working group \non protected areas and wildlife (SGAPFS) of \nCOMIFAC took the initiative to develop \u201cBest prac-\ntices for the management of protected areas through \npublic-private partnerships in Central Africa\u201d. This \nprocess incorporated two workshops (December 2017 \nin Libreville, and April 2018 in Douala) resulting in \nguidelines that were further developed, published and \nadopted by COMIFAC\u2019s Board of Ministers in July \n2019 (COMIFAC, 2018).\nAlongside these initiatives, we collected details \non Central African protected areas partnerships, \ncompiled external evaluations from the partnerships \nand tried to draw further lessons. This allowed a first \ncomparison with protected areas partnerships else-\nwhere in Africa, highlighting regional differences and \npossible solutions (Scholte et al., 2018).\nThe present chapter builds on these PPP review \ninitiatives, presents new data on partnership \ncontracts, and provides subsequent insights that may \nassist the further development of these partnerships. \nIt thereby provides an overview of partnership expe-\nriences and allows to draw lessons from this form of \nmanagement as it applies to the specific ecological \nand socio-\u00ad\neconomic context of Central Africa. This \nshould lead to a deeper understanding of delegated \nmanagement and allow governmental bodies to be \nin a better position to take informed decisions on \npossible delegated management of one or more of \nits protected areas. And, should they do so, prepare \nthemselves accordingly. \nWe start off reviewing the differences between \nmanagement and governance (section 1).\n\nDocument 287: 122\n122\n5. Conclusions \nand recommendations\n5.1 Conclusions\nSince the establishment of the contracts for \nGaramba and Virunga National Parks in 2005, \npublic-private partnerships have become an impor-\ntant tool for the management of protected areas in \nCentral Africa. The six contracts that reached the \nend of their terms were all extended, unlike in other \nAfrican countries, notably Ethiopia.\nAfrican Parks Network dominated the PPP land-\nscape in Central Africa in the early years and remains \nan important actor, holding six of the 13 PPP contracts \nwhich are active in the sub-region. WWF and WCS, \nwhich also have been very present in this region for \ndecades through the provision of technical assistance, \nhave recently converted their historic collaboration in \ncertain protected areas into PPPs, which testifies to \nthe interest in this model. Furthermore, new actors \nare gradually emerging, such as Forgotten Parks (in \nDRC) and more recently No\u00e9 (in negotiations for two \nPPPs in Chad and Congo).\nSince the first partnership contracts were signed in \n2005, major changes have resulted in a second gener-\nation of contracts. This evolution notably includes \ngreater ownership by governments, which have \nformulated increasingly detailed expectations. The \nexample of the Garamba contract is instructive. In \n2005, it only contained seven pages without specific \nexpectations; in 2016, the contract had extended to 24 \npages and included specific targets.\nTo strengthen the appropriation of PPPs by \ngovernments, COMIFAC has developed a guide \nto best-practices for the management of protected \nareas through PPPs (available in French, Guide Sous-\u00ad\nR\u00e9gional de Bonnes Pratiques pour la Gestion des Aires \nProt\u00e9g\u00e9es en Mode Partenariat Public-Priv\u00e9 PPP en \nAfrique Centrale). The guide focuses on the prepara-\ntion of tender documents to draw the attention of \ndecision-makers to the gaps and weaknesses to be \navoided in each of the four phases of the development \nprocess of a PPP project.\nThe diversification of PPPs in Central Africa, \nmoving beyond the \u201ctotal\u201d delegated management \nmodel, remains tentative.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":242,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

There is \nno ability to measure progress toward a \u201cdesired state\u201d \nof co-existence nor to demonstrate wise investment.\nThe lack of a long-term goal means there is: i) no \nimpetus to capture a baseline and therefore nothing \nto measure progress and impact against; ii) a lack of \nfoundation for a long-term commitment; iii) a lack of \nability to report at completion on the impact of the \ninterventions; iv) ultimately a weak ability to argue \nfor stronger regulatory and policy foundations in \ngovernment to mainstream human-wildlife conflict.\nPrinciples of SAFE\nA SAFE approach to human-wildlife conflict \nprovides a holistic view of the conflict in its \nentirety.

These\u00a0include the national parks of Bouba-Ndjida, Benoue and Faro \nin\u00a0Cameroon, the complexes of protected areas in the northeast and the Chinko \nregion of the Central African Republic (CAR), and Garamba National Park and \nBili\u2011Uere Hunting Estate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nWhile transhumant pastoralism has been practiced \nfor many years in these areas, the expanded network \nand strengthened management measures of protected \nareas \u2013 known as \u201cpaper parks\u201d  \u2013 have focused atten-\ntion on the question of the coexistence of protected \nareas and transhumance. \nIn 2019, the N\u2019Djamena conference made it \npossible to include this topic in the policy agenda \nof Central African regional institutions. However, \nthe linking of transhumance, poaching, illegal traf-\nficking and the movement of armed groups steered \ndiscussions towards a security approach to trans\u00ad\nhumance. Conservation officers of protected areas \ncannot effectively manage such an approach alone as \nthey have neither the means nor a mandate to deal \nwith security issues. \nThis chapter attempts to explore the interface \nbetween protected areas and transhumance, a form \nof pastoralism. It highlights the broad elements \nneeded for understanding this issue while empha-\nsizing the fact that the way it is expressed varies \ndepending on the specific characteristics of each site \nand protected area.\nPastoralism contributes significantly to the Gross \nDomestic Product (GDP) of Central African states. \nIt is a complex production system characterized by \nmobility that can take many forms depending on the \nenvironment. It is currently subject to heavy pres-\nsures, both short-term and structural, and the way \nthat pastoralism evolves will dramatically change the \nmanagement of protected areas in the long run.\n\nDocument 569: However, proposals for action consistently iden-\ntify the need to integrate transhumant pastoralism \ninto the management of protected areas in order to \nmitigate local conflicts likely to affect wildlife habi-\ntats. This approach also requires an understanding \nof the challenges which exist at the scale of trans\u00ad\nhumance territories and regions when cross-border \n\u00ad\ntranshumance is involved. \n2.1 Each site faces very specific \nchallenges\nThe challenges of the pastoralism-protected area \ninterface can vary depending on the sites and the \nareas surrounding them, their ecological features, \ngeographic \nlocation, \nneighboring \ncommunities, \npolitical and socioeconomic organization, type of \npastoralism practiced, etc. However, in most cases, they \nreflect conflictual relationships between pastoralists, \nfarmers and conservation officers around questions of \naccess to resources, wildlife habitat degradation and \npoaching. \nTo cope with these situations, most recommended \nmeasures seek to closely integrate biodiversity conser-\nvation and local development in the peripheries of \nprotected areas, especially since these outlying areas \nare characterized by the extreme poverty of the people \nliving in them. \nThe cases of Waza National Park, the Greater \nZakouma ecosystem and the Bili-Uere - Garamba \n- Chinko landscape present diverse problems and \nproposed solutions.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":594,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

Various questions about human-elephant \nconflict need to be answered, most notably: reports \nby farmers themselves have been shown to over\u00ad\nestimate the real impact of damage by crop-raiding \nspecies; so what is the exact amount of crop-raiding \nby forest elephants and how does it compare to less \nvisible species (such as rodents)? How effective are \nmitigation methods in reducing tangible costs? How \ncan we measure and monitor intangible costs to better \naddress them? How does crop-raiding and trampling \ndamage impact the harvest in palm oil or agroforestry \nplantations (e.g., African oil palm, safou (Dacryodes \nedulis), kola nut (Cola spp.), etc.)?\nStandardized data collection protocols have been \ndeveloped for savanna elephants that have been used \nto quantify the impact of crop raiding (Hoare, 1999, \n2000b; Parker et al., 2007). However, it has been \nextremely challenging to confirm whether reported \n(or perceived) impacts reflect real impacts because of \nthe time required for wildlife managers to confirm \nraids.

Clearly, human activities (poaching, \nlinear infrastructure, road traffic), strongly impact \npopulation-wide-elephant distribution (Laurance \net al., 2006; Stokes et al., 2010; Yackulic et al., 2011). \nForest elephants avoid areas of high-poaching inten-\nsity and take refuge in secure areas, leading to locally \nhigh forest elephant abundance and intensified crop \nraiding near villages where elephants feel safe (Breuer \net al., 2016). However, the degree of impact remains \nto be studied. Additionally, forest elephants appear \nto be attracted to secondary forest and there might \nbe a link between logging disturbance and increased \nlevels of crop-raiding incidents. Therefore, natural \nand anthropogenic factors work in combination.\n3.4 Monitoring the conflict, its\u00a0impacts \nand the effectiveness of conflict \nmanagement interventions\nDespite the multitude of review articles on \nhuman-wildlife conflict, the existence of many \ndifferent human-wildlife conflict manuals (Nelson \net al., 2003; Parker et al., 2007; Walpole & Linkie, \n2007; Fernando et al., 2008; Osei-Owusu & Bakker, \n2008; WWF, 2008; Lamarque et al., 2009; Osei-\nOwusu, 2018), and the availability of online resource \npages, there is a paucity of data on the effectiveness \nof conflict management measures in Central Africa. \nThis contrasts with other regions in Africa and Asia, \nwhere mitigation measures have been studied in detail \n(Davies et al., 2011; Gunaryadi et al., 2017; Branco \net al., 2019; Scheijen et al., 2019) and occasionally \nhave succeeded in reducing the conflict to tolerable \nlevels. However, mitigation measures in isolation will \nnot be successful and must be integrated into larger\n\nDocument 447: In addition, it is \nimportant to realize that each location has its own set \nof factors affecting the spatial and temporal pattern \nand intensity of crop raiding, and hence the different \noptions available to mitigate the conflict. While there \nis a deepened understanding of some of the factors \naffecting the vulnerability of farms to crop-raiding \nelephants in savanna ecosystems, little is known about \nforest elephants.\nA variety of factors are likely to affect susceptibility \nto crop raiding (Sitati, Walpole & Leader-Williams, \n2005; Graham et al., 2010; Guerbois et al., 2012; \nGoswami et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2015; Gross et al., \n2018). They are related to the behavior of crop-raiding \nelephants (Osborn, 2004; Chiyo & Cochrane, 2005; \nRode et al., 2006; Chiyo et al., 2011; Chiyo et al., 2012; \nGunn et al., 2014), natural features (biophysical: e.g., \ndensity of elephants, proximity to natural habitat and \nfeeding sites, rainfall, topography, availability of wild \nfruits, etc.) as well as intrinsic features of the farms \n(crop species, stage of ripening of crops, farm size \nand location, cultivation cycles of local farmers, effec-\ntiveness of farm protection measures, etc.) (Barnes \net al., 1995; Barnes et al., 2005; Lahm, 1996; Nchanji \n& Lawson, 1998; Osborn, 2003; Boafo et al., 2004; \nChiyo et al., 2005; Kofi Sam et al., 2005; Gross et al., \n2018; Snyder et al., 2020).\nThe biophysical vulnerability to crop raiding \npatterns in Central African forested areas is poorly \nunderstood and shows many site-specific patterns. \nThus, to predict these patterns, we need to understand \nwhy and when forest elephants raid crops.

However, even though \norganized wildlife crime is increasing in the subre-\ngion, there is still no regional unification of legislation \non wildlife and protected areas, as the priorities of \nCEEAC member States end with the harmonization \nof national policies.\n\nDocument 89: 38\n3. Continually evolving legislation \nGovernments have a range of tools at their disposal \nto combat biodiversity loss. All Central African coun-\ntries have ratified various international agreements \nand conventions that provide a general framework \nfor actions and policies promoting better coexistence \nbetween humanity and the rest of the living world. \nHowever, it is national legislation that has the force \nof law above all else. Moreover, to be effective, such \nlegislation must be enforced by all stakeholders, not \njust protected area managers.\nSince 2015 and the first State of Protected Areas \n(Doumenge et al., 2015a), a number of new pieces \nof legislation have been enacted or revised. This \nis the case, for example, of the law of 8 July 2020 \nconcerning the forestry code in Congo, which intro-\nduced the notion of \u201cecological damage\u201d that the \nState is likely to suffer as a result of actions against \nforest ecosystems. One of the changes observed in \nforest management also concerns conservation forest \nconcessions, which DRC has set up (see box). This \ntype of concession can complement the network of \nprotected areas in the subregion (see section 1.3), \nprovided that the laws and regulations are respected \nand that the objectives and management of these \nconcessions allow for effective biodiversity \u00ad\nprotection \n(which may not always be the case; Wabiwa Betoko \n& de Hoog, 2021). However, this offers new opportu-\nnities for biodiversity protection and raises questions \nabout the inclusion of this type of land use in the \nglobal database of protected areas.\nThe level of protection provided for in the texts \nvaries greatly according to the type of ecosystems and \nthreats identified on the wild fauna and flora. Since \n2017, a decree designates ICCN as the manage-\nment body of the Convention on International Trade \nin Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora \n(CITES) in DRC.\n\nDocument 118: 52\nIn the Dja Faunal Reserve in Cameroon, local \nresidents have organized themselves into vigilance \ncommittees, under the impetus of the NGO African \nWildlife Foundation (AWF), to support the conser-\nvation of this protected area. These committees \nwere established by decision of the administrative \nauthority and received logistical support funded by \nthe ECOFAC 6 program. The information provided \nby these committees led to the seizure of weapons, \nammunition and poached meat in the reserve, as \nwell as to the arrest of several poachers (Epanda \net al., 2019).\nSuch approaches are beneficial in that they allow, \nthrough the analysis of the information collected, a \nbetter knowledge of the presence of armed groups \nfrom other parts of the country or from neighboring \ncountries. They also make it possible to concentrate \npatrols in the most sensitive crime areas and to be \nmore efficient in the organization of these patrols. \nThis ultimately allows better management of material \nand human resources. \nThese different initiatives have the advantage \nof involving and empowering communities against \nexternal aggression, particularly poaching and illegal \nexploitation of timber resources. They also allow these \ncommunities to benefit from additional financial \nincome (in the form of salaries) and thus to be able to \nmeet their families\u2019 daily needs. \nDespite the promising results of these oversight \ncommittees, they still face difficulties. These are \nrelated to, among other things, death threats made \nby poachers who are arrested, cases of complicity \nbetween some committee members and poachers, a \nlack of legal coverage and non-responsiveness of the \ngovernment \u2013 which leads to discouragement \u2013 and \na lack of adequate equipment (Epanda et al., 2019).\nIt also should be noted that these participatory \nmonitoring initiatives must grapple with a continuing \nlack of recognition in existing regulations. The ques-\ntion of responsibilities, as well as the support of the \ncommunities involved, remains problematic and is \nnot always very clear.\nTo protect their wildlife resources, Central \nAfrican countries nevertheless have adopted \nincreasingly dissuasive laws and ratified several \ninternational conventions, including CITES (Ngeh \net al., 2018).","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":92,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

Conclusions \nand recommendations\n5.1 Conclusions\nSince the establishment of the contracts for \nGaramba and Virunga National Parks in 2005, \npublic-private partnerships have become an impor-\ntant tool for the management of protected areas in \nCentral Africa. The six contracts that reached the \nend of their terms were all extended, unlike in other \nAfrican countries, notably Ethiopia.\nAfrican Parks Network dominated the PPP land-\nscape in Central Africa in the early years and remains \nan important actor, holding six of the 13 PPP contracts \nwhich are active in the sub-region. WWF and WCS, \nwhich also have been very present in this region for \ndecades through the provision of technical assistance, \nhave recently converted their historic collaboration in \ncertain protected areas into PPPs, which testifies to \nthe interest in this model. Furthermore, new actors \nare gradually emerging, such as Forgotten Parks (in \nDRC) and more recently No\u00e9 (in negotiations for two \nPPPs in Chad and Congo).\nSince the first partnership contracts were signed in \n2005, major changes have resulted in a second gener-\nation of contracts. This evolution notably includes \ngreater ownership by governments, which have \nformulated increasingly detailed expectations. The \nexample of the Garamba contract is instructive. In \n2005, it only contained seven pages without specific \nexpectations; in 2016, the contract had extended to 24 \npages and included specific targets.\nTo strengthen the appropriation of PPPs by \ngovernments, COMIFAC has developed a guide \nto best-practices for the management of protected \nareas through PPPs (available in French, Guide Sous-\u00ad\nR\u00e9gional de Bonnes Pratiques pour la Gestion des Aires \nProt\u00e9g\u00e9es en Mode Partenariat Public-Priv\u00e9 PPP en \nAfrique Centrale). The guide focuses on the prepara-\ntion of tender documents to draw the attention of \ndecision-makers to the gaps and weaknesses to be \navoided in each of the four phases of the development \nprocess of a PPP project.\nThe diversification of PPPs in Central Africa, \nmoving beyond the \u201ctotal\u201d delegated management \nmodel, remains tentative.\n\nDocument 258: 108\n108\n\u00ad\nconsidered to be the exclusive responsibility of the \nState in Central Africa. However, there has increas-\ningly been an effort to bring together the \u201cbest of both \nworlds\u201d by having staff with governmental contracts \nin the parks\u2019 organigrams. They are thereby allowed \nto wear arms and verbalize people while being under \nthe management of the private partner. We exam-\nined the PPP contracts in our possession to reflect \nthe diversity of possibilities to organize law enforce-\nment under this model, and presented schematically \nhow the various partnerships have dealt with this \nissue (see Table\u202f1). Note that this presentation is \nschematic and reflects our own interpretation. We \nalso added other forms of management, i.e., lease, \nas applied by trophy hunting enterprises (see\u00a0 also \nsection 4).\nTable\u202f1 \u2013 Protected areas with delegated, co-management and lease agreements  \nin Central Africa: law enforcement details\nCountry\nProtected \nArea\nPrivate \nAgency\nManagement \ntype\nLaw enforcement role\nCollaboration \nwith armed \nforces \nNotes\nPrivate partner \npersonnel\nState contracted \ndetached\nManagers\nGuards Managers\nGuards\nCameroon\nHunting \nzones\nIndividuals\/ \ncompanies\nLease\n+\n++\n\u2013\n\u2013\n+\/\u2013\nRole of private \npartner has not \nbeen formalized, \nbut tolerated\nCAR\nChinko\nAPN\nDM\n++\n++\n\u2013\n\u2013\nNorth CAR\nAPN\nDM\nChad\nEnnedi \nAPN\nDM\nZakouma\nAPN\nDM\n+\/\u2013\n\u2013\n+\n++\n+\nDeputy director \nwith state contract\nCongo\nNouabal\u00e9-\nNdoki\nWCS\nDM\n\u2013\n\u2013\n+\n++\n+\/\u2013\nHead of anti-\npoaching with \nstate contract\nOdzala \nAPN\nDM\nDRC\nGaramba\nAPN\nDM\n+\/\u2013\n\u2013\n+\n++\n+\/\u2013\nHead of anti-\npoaching with \nstate contract\nSalonga\nWWF\nCo-m\nUpemba-\nKundelunga\nForgotten \nParks\nDM\n++\n++\nPark director with \nstate and private \npartner contract\nVirunga\nVF\nDM\n++\n\u2013\n++\n++\n+\/\u2013\nRwanda\nAkagera\nAPN\nDM\n+\/\u2013\n\u2013\u2013\n+\n++\n+\nHead of anti-\npoaching with \nstate contract\nNotes: The contracts that we have not been able to see (Okapi, DRC) are not included.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":243,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

Within \nthe framework of the CAWHFI (Central African \nWorld Heritage Forest Initiative) project, aware-\nness-raising and the integration of communities in \nAPDS monitoring committees have thus encouraged \nlocal populations to oppose the armed groups active \nin CAR and to prevent them from penetrating into \nthe protected areas. Countries such as Cameroon and \nDRC also have set up village monitoring committees \n(known as COVAREF or Comit\u00e9s de Valorisation des \nRessources Fauniques) and \u00ad\nfarmer-forest committees.\n\nDocument 112: 49\nYet the conservation paradigm has evolved over \ntime, notably with the adoption of the CBD in 1992, \nin which biodiversity conservation and sustainable use \nare asserted as inseparable (Adam, 2012). Local and \nindigenous communities must be, along with other \nactors, including the State and conservation NGOs, \nat the heart of their management. Their involvement \nis motivated by the fact that over many generations \nthey have developed a body of knowledge that has \nenabled them to live and nourish themselves from \nthe forest and its biodiversity while preserving its \n\u00ad\nproductive capacities (FAO, 2016). \nEven if this is not yet sufficiently realized on \nthe ground, functional changes have been made \nin the definition of the management objectives of \nprotected areas, with a view to contributing to the \nstrengthening of the link between conservation and \nnatural resource use. The establishment of the IUCN \nprotected area categories, for example (see Figure\u202f1), \nrefers to different conceptions of the place of humans \nin environmental protection policies (H\u00e9ritier & \nLaslaz, 2008). \nThe operationalization of the community partici-\npatory approach in the creation and management of \nprotected areas translates into interventions at two \nlevels: the revision of regulatory frameworks and the \ndevelopment of initiatives that operationalize partici-\npatory approaches. However, each country\u2019s legislation \nand management objectives provide different oppor-\ntunities for the participation of local communities.

These committees \nwere established by decision of the administrative \nauthority and received logistical support funded by \nthe ECOFAC 6 program. The information provided \nby these committees led to the seizure of weapons, \nammunition and poached meat in the reserve, as \nwell as to the arrest of several poachers (Epanda \net al., 2019).\nSuch approaches are beneficial in that they allow, \nthrough the analysis of the information collected, a \nbetter knowledge of the presence of armed groups \nfrom other parts of the country or from neighboring \ncountries. They also make it possible to concentrate \npatrols in the most sensitive crime areas and to be \nmore efficient in the organization of these patrols. \nThis ultimately allows better management of material \nand human resources. \nThese different initiatives have the advantage \nof involving and empowering communities against \nexternal aggression, particularly poaching and illegal \nexploitation of timber resources. They also allow these \ncommunities to benefit from additional financial \nincome (in the form of salaries) and thus to be able to \nmeet their families\u2019 daily needs. \nDespite the promising results of these oversight \ncommittees, they still face difficulties. These are \nrelated to, among other things, death threats made \nby poachers who are arrested, cases of complicity \nbetween some committee members and poachers, a \nlack of legal coverage and non-responsiveness of the \ngovernment \u2013 which leads to discouragement \u2013 and \na lack of adequate equipment (Epanda et al., 2019).\nIt also should be noted that these participatory \nmonitoring initiatives must grapple with a continuing \nlack of recognition in existing regulations.

If this initiative becomes a reality, it could help to formalize this activity to a certain extent, and to integrate consideration of environmental concerns.","reference_context":"Document 660: This will profoundly \nchange the accessibility of southern Cameroon (and \naccess to various protected areas), and also carries \nthe risk of potential land use conflicts with other \nindustrial forestry and agricultural projects (Noiraud \net al., 2017). As Sundance Resources was unable to \nstart the Mbalam project, Cameroon reportedly \ndecided to withdraw the permit and award it to a \nconsortium of five Chinese state-owned compa-\nnies; at the same time, the Congolese government \nalso awarded the Nabeba permit to a new company \n(Mbodiam, 2021).\nBefore a mining claim is granted, the mining \ncode requires prior approval from the relevant public \nauthorities, which allow mining operations to be \nconducted in and around national parks and protected \nareas subject to international agreements. In 2012, an \norder by the minister in charge of mines prohibited \nillegal gold mining in protected areas in Cameroon, \nand made any gold mining activity in protected areas \nsubject to prior authorization by the administrations \nin charge of mines, forests and wildlife, environment \nand nature protection (MINMIDT, 2012). \nHowever, given the widespread presence of many \nartisanal gold miners in much of the country, from \nthe south up to Adamaoua, including in protected \nareas, it has been difficult to enforce this ministe-\nrial order (Noiraud et al., 2017). This is the case in \nthe inter-zones of the TRIDOM landscape, both in \nCameroon and Gabon. In Gabon, the government \ndid, however, forcibly evacuate the gold mining \ncamps that existed inside and around Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 \nNational Park in 2011 and 2013 (Anon., 2013). \nCollaboration between the administrations in \ncharge of mining, conservation services and even the \nmilitary is necessary to clean up the artisanal mining \nsector, especially in protected areas.\nIn order to structure the artisanal sector and to \npromote the participation of national operators, \nCameroon is trying to develop a semi-industrial \nmining sector with a low level of mechanization.

This \nis the case for the mining of gold and semi-precious \nstones (Noiraud et al., 2017). However, cohabita-\ntion between artisanal diggers and semi-mechanized \nCameroonian companies, but also sometimes foreign \ncompanies (Korean, Chinese, South African, etc.), \nleads more often to conflictual relations than good \nintegration (Voundi et al., 2019); with sometimes very \nsignificant social and environmental impacts.\n\nDocument 689: It seems to have decreased in Gabon (Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 and periphery) following \nforceful action by the government. The area most affected is the Dja Faunal Reserve. The \narea around Ngoyla in Cameroon also has about 22 artisanal gold mining sites.\nA new, semi-industrial gold mining sector, often involving Chinese operators, is further-\nmore rapidly devastating large areas of land, mining gold in an uncontrolled manner (and \nremoving the gold that was the livelihood of artisanal gold miners) and heavily polluting \nrivers and springs. Despite government commitments to clean up the sector, a human and \necological disaster is underway.\nThe environmental impacts of these illegal practices are disastrous. They range from erosion \nto the diversion of watercourses through siltation (Tieguhong et al., 2009). This activity \ngenerates several impacts, including deforestation and forest degradation, ecosystem \npollution, poaching and fragmentation of wildlife habitats, alongside a deterioration in the \nliving and working conditions of the gold miners.\nArtisanal and semi-industrial gold mining needs to be effectively regulated and legalized to \nend the poaching associated with these mining sites and reduce pollution. This is particu-\nlarly true of mercury pollution, the effects of which on human and ecosystem health in the \nTRIDOM cannot currently be assessed. It is also a question of encouraging and reserving \ngold mining activities for national citizens, under the framework of a reorganization of the \ngold sales channels controlled by the States. \nIn Gabon, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Equatoriale des Mines (SEM), plans to support the creation of gold \nminer cooperatives. This state-owned enterprise was established a few years ago to oversee \nthe development of the mining sector and manage government holdings in mining projects. \nSEM plans to assist, train and equip gold miners so that they can engage in an activity \nthat will enable them to generate income over an extended period of time (Ondo Nzuey, \n2019). If this initiative becomes a reality, it could make it possible to formalize this activity \nto a certain extent, and to integrate consideration of environmental concerns. However, if \nimplemented, this experiment should be evaluated and its potential for \u00ad\nextension to other \nareas examined.\n\nDocument 659: This company\u2019s objec-\ntives will be to conduct mineral resource inventories in \npartnership with other actors, implement exploration \nand exploitation activities, ensure the restoration of sites \nafter exploitation and obtain stakes in all \u00ad\ncompanies \nwith links to the mining sector (S.A., 2020).\nHowever, these objectives have not yet been trans-\nlated into operational industrial projects due to a \nnumber of unfavorable factors (drop in mineral prices, \nCovid-19, opaque governance, etc.). For example, the \nfirst major cobalt-nickel-manganese mining claim, \nheld by the American company Geovic in southeast \nCameroon (Nkamouna), still has not yet seen the \nlight of day (Noiraud et al., 2017; Anon., 2021). \nAnother major undertaking intended to launch \nCameroon\u2019s industrial mining activity is the Mbal-\nam-Nabeba project, operated by Camiron and \nSundance Resources to exploit vast iron ore deposits \non the Cameroon-Congolese border. This project is \nassociated with the construction of a railway to the \nport of Kribi (about 550\u2009km). This will profoundly \nchange the accessibility of southern Cameroon (and \naccess to various protected areas), and also carries \nthe risk of potential land use conflicts with other \nindustrial forestry and agricultural projects (Noiraud \net al., 2017). As Sundance Resources was unable to \nstart the Mbalam project, Cameroon reportedly \ndecided to withdraw the permit and award it to a \nconsortium of five Chinese state-owned compa-\nnies; at the same time, the Congolese government \nalso awarded the Nabeba permit to a new company \n(Mbodiam, 2021).\nBefore a mining claim is granted, the mining \ncode requires prior approval from the relevant public \nauthorities, which allow mining operations to be \nconducted in and around national parks and protected \nareas subject to international agreements.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":660,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

However, it is important \nto understand that forest elephants have extremely \nslow population growth rates (Turkalo et al., 2017), \nand the apparent increase in conflict is thus not due \nto a sudden increase in the local forest elephant \npopulations. Rather, the continuous immigration and \nexpansion of people into forest lands, the increase of \nthe density of the last elephant populations repelled \nin these forest tracks, the lack of effective mitigation \nmethods, and potentially an increase in so-called \nproblem elephants, are among the main reasons \nbehind the increasing conflict. \nIn summary, a diversity of factors must be consid-\nered when dealing with human-elephant conflicts, \nincluding elephant and human populations\u2019 dynamics \nand behavior, as well as environmental factors \n(Figure\u202f1).

Increasing habitat loss and fragmen-\ntation due to development of linear infrastructure, \n\u00ad\nexpansion of human settlements and people\u2019s need for \nland, agriculture and pastures are resulting in a serious \nincrease in human-wildlife conflict zones throughout \nthe continent (Kleinschroth et al., 2019).\nPoaching has worsened the situation on various \nlevels. For example, conflicts are exacerbated due to the \nphenomenon of compression into protected areas and \nthe loss of fear of humans due to local high levels of \nprotection, and the attraction of elephants to secondary \nforest with its dense understory (Nchanji & Lawson, \n1998; Naughton et al., 1999; \u00ad\nNaughton-Treves & \nTreves, 2005; Breuer et al., 2016). Given the anthro-\npogenic impacts on forest elephants, the killing of \nlarger older tuskers with the resulting loss of ecolog-\nical knowledge, heightened aggression and increased \nexploratory behavior of younger males combined with \nincreased compression and fragmentation, it is very \nlikely that human-elephant conflict is going to severely \nincrease in the future, despite an overall decline \nin forest elephant numbers (Breuer\u00a0et al.,\u00a02016). \nThis\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0\u00ad\nexaggerated by the deteriorating social \ncontext (e.g., increased poverty, civil and political \ninstability, worsened governmental support, rapid \npopulation growth and land needs, but also rural \nexodus, etc.) in some Central African countries (e.g., \nsocial vulnerability).

To the north of the reserve, \nindustrial exploration sites have been granted to Banro Congo Mining, and toward the south-\nwest, to Regal Bluent Mining (close to the outer limits of the reserve). Added to these are \nnumerous artisanal mining sites scattered across the landscape. The quarry in Zombe is the \nmost striking case. \nThis quarry is located northwest of the reserve (Figure\u202f10) and includes several artisanal \ncassiterite mines.

With an estimated \nworkforce of \u00b1 1,250 artisanal diggers (according to the 2018 Quarry Management Committee \nreport), demand for energy resources is very high. Apart from the tradition practice of the \nBasile chiefdom in Mwenga territory, which bans women from settling in the Zombe mine and \nliving with men in order to build a real village, there are no other measures in place to curb \nthis high demographic growth.\n\nDocument 611: These resources are coveted by multinational \nfirms as well as small-scale prospectors.

The economic growth and \nemergence plans drawn up by the States rely mainly on the exploitation of mineral \nresources. While mining and oil industries can be sources of employment (albeit \ngenerally modest) and wealth, they also can cause substantial environmental and \nsocioeconomic damage (Carbonnier, 2013; Mar\u00e9chal, 2013; Noiraud et al.,\u00a02017; \nChuhan-Pole et al., 2020). However, this damage can be mitigated, and\u00a0there \nalso are potential opportunities for investments in biodiversity protection.\nCountries in the subregion grew by an average \nof 5.8% between 2001-2012, compared to 3.0% \nbetween 1990-2000, enabling Central Africa to \nrecord the second highest growth rate in Africa over \nthis period (BAD, 2013).

Unfortunately, the antic-\nipated upturn was short-lived, with growth rates \ndropping to 1.1% in 2017, rising slightly to 2.2% \nin 2018 (BAD, 2019), only to be followed by the \ncrisis induced by the Covid-19 pandemic that began \nin early 2020 (BAD, 2020). This weak performance \nis largely due to limited local processing capacities \nfor raw materials, which are mostly exported unpro-\ncessed, thereby reducing the value added of these \nproducts. Similarly, fluctuations in the price of raw \nmaterials on the international market contribute to \nthe vulnerability of economies based on the export \nof these raw materials, including minerals. Most \nof the major mining projects, particularly iron ore \nexploitation, also have not yet materialized due to \nthe fall in ore prices on the international market, a \nphenomenon linked to increased iron production in \nother regions of the world.\n\nDocument 613: 1.

However, \nfor its potential to be fully exploited and for managers \nand policy makers to achieve their goals and reverse \ncurrent trends, a change in culture is needed. Data \nproviders, managers and researchers must pull together \nand establish a dialogue that can ensure a contin-\nuous flow of information between all stakeholders. \nThis could generate a virtuous circle to better guide \nresearch and the collection of critical information, \nsupporting better planning that will enable actions \nin the field to be better targeted. These are the foun-\ndations of a proactive and results-oriented approach, \nbased on informed and effective decision-making.\nTo do so, it is essential to be able to rely on user-\nfriendly information systems, easy to access and \nsearch, based on well-structured databases from \nwhich information can be easily extracted. Above \nall, these databases must help to better present the \nreality on the ground. Through the analysis of this \ninformation, it will then be possible to formulate \nthe most appropriate operational recommendations \npossible with regard to the actions and strategies to \nbe implemented at the site, country and subregional \nlevels. While qualitative information can be useful for \ndecision-making, the use of quantitative information \nshould be improved. The latter allows for a simpler \nand finer representation of the situation as well as the \ncomparison, scaling and repetition of assessments. \n \nThe process should encourage a better use of infor-\nmation by enhancing the information that already \nexists, but also promote the collection and search for \nessential information that will enable better targeted \ninterventions.\nThe capacity to analyze the information avail-\nable and formulate operational recommendations is \nwithout doubt a critical component in the chain of \ninformation processing in which investments will \nbe essential. Human capacity building is undoubt-\nedly one of the priorities for intervention. OFAC \ncan and should play a central role in the region in \nthe management, analysis and flow of information, as \nwell as in capacity building, facilitating better coor-\ndination between different intervention levels and \nby supporting countries in their efforts to formulate \npriorities and policies.\nHowever, all of this alone is not enough.\n\nDocument 363: 158\nThe main constraints to the proper functioning of \na regional observatory like OFAC concern the availa-\nbility of the necessary resources in terms of staff (skills \nand profiles), infrastructure and funding, but also the \nneed to interact openly with each country. To achieve \nthe shared objectives of increasing \u201cuseful knowledge\u201d \nand facilitating the emergence of an overall regional \nvision, it is essential that countries share the infor-\nmation which they have and that they adhere to the \napproach advocated by a regional observatory. Coun-\ntries must simultaneously rely on the observatory\u2019s \nservices and value its role for their own benefit and \nthat of the region as a whole.\n7. Preliminary considerations  \nfor an action plan\u00a0\nIt is often said that information is power. In the \nfield of conservation, information can be viewed by \na protected area manager as \u201cthe power to protect \nthe area and its associated assets\u201d. However, to what \nextent can we become good conservation managers by \nfinding and using good information? How can \u201cgood \ninformation\u201d give us the power to move in the right \ndirection? Here are a few answers that could be given \nto these questions: \n\u2022\t information makes it possible to know the assets \nand wealth that we need to manage;\n\u2022\t it allows us to stay a step ahead of threats and \nopportunities, and to take a proactive approach;\n\u2022\t it strengthens the validity of our intervention \nbecause it favors the adoption of innovative, flexible \nand adaptive management in terms of conservation;\n\u2022\t it makes management effective and efficient \nbecause it is results-oriented;\n\u2022\t it makes it possible to consider and make suitable \ndecisions in real time.\nDespite all of these advantages, some protected \narea managers do not use information correctly. As \nsomething which can be stored, analyzed and used to \nbetter achieve objectives which have been set, infor-\nmation has enabled the transformation and evolution \nof various activity sectors in the world today. Although \nit could play the same role in conservation, some \nprotected area managers seem to tend to overlook its \nimportance.\nOne of the main reasons for this attitude is that \nwe believe that our knowledge and experience match \nthe information we need to manage.\n\nDocument 367: To \nimprove the management of conservation sites and of \nthe impact of human interventions, it is essential to:\n1.\u202frecognize the contribution of information to \nthe effective, proactive and targeted management of \nprotected areas and the overall environment;\n2.\u202fmake the most of the knowledge and experience \nof field actors by combining these with information \nproduced by scientists and other data providers;\n3.\u202forient the collection of data and knowledge \naround well-targeted management objectives in a \nresults-oriented management framework;\n4.\u202fdevelop synergies and design coordinated data \ncollection approaches by promoting more direct \ninvolvement of managers in identifying and formu-\nlating information needs;\n5.\u202fensure better use of the information available \nby facilitating access and effective use for operational \npurposes.

This indicates that coordination \nbetween the various government services involved can \nremain tricky. Despite this, protected areas are grad-\nually becoming the subject of a coordinated approach \namong government departments and local authorities, \nrather than being seen as a sectoral issue. The imple-\nmentation of the principles of integrated land-use \nplanning should, in this respect, help to promote new \nsynergies between administrations.\n4. The management of protected \nareas under question\nThe data presented in section 1 show that most \nCentral African countries have or will be able to \nachieve Aichi Target 11 (17% of territories classified \nas protected areas) \u2013 at least on land \u2013 or even the \n30% target under negotiation.

Although the forest (in some regions) and large \nfauna (in general) are under significant pressure, the \necological frameworks (forests and savannas, aquatic \necosystems, etc.) often remain, allowing biodiversity \nto be dispersed (see section 2).\n\nDocument 72: This example is not an isolated case \nand could, in the long run, lead to a set of territories \nwith a primary conservation vocation, which would \n\u00ad\ncomplement the \u201cclassic\u201d network of protected areas.\nThese different examples show that from different \npieces of legislation (forestry laws, wildlife and \nconservation laws), it is possible to set up spaces for \nbiodiversity conservation (see also Doumenge et al., \n2015b). However, all of these elements raise the \nquestion of the effectiveness of the management of \nthese territories with regard to conservation objec-\ntives and the application of laws (Wabiwa Betoko & \nde Hoog, 2021). Another question mentioned earlier \nconcerns the harmonization of approaches and desig-\nnations between countries. A shared, expanded and \n\u00ad\nharmonized frame of reference would be desirable.\nHowever, the efforts made to increase the \nnumber of protected areas should not absolve the \nStates of their environmental responsibilities outside \nprotected areas, meaning in 70 to 83% of the terri-\ntories, depending on the objectives set. The question \nis no longer to pit strong protection zones against \nweak protection zones (Denhez, 2020), but to \ndevelop territorial projects where hotspots of high \nbiodiversity value are connected through a network \nof ecological corridors supporting socio-economic \nactivities that respect the environment.\nOverall, there is an urgent need to consider \nother concepts, such as IUCN\u2019s Other Effective \narea-based Conservation Measures (OECM). \nBiodiversity conservation strategies cannot stop \nat the borders of protected areas. They must cover\n\nDocument 126: However, in order to \nagree on the territories taken into account for the vali-\ndation of these objectives, international efforts must \nbe made to develop a common frame of reference to \nrecognize and categorize all those spaces that can be \nconsidered to be protected areas.\nThe maintenance of functional biodiversity on a \nglobal scale cannot ignore the role that certain areas \ndedicated to the sustainable use of wildlife and forest \nresources can play in maintaining a functional green \nand blue frameworks. The role of some ZICs and \nmanaged and certified forest concessions may indeed \nbe important in strengthening the connectivity of \nprotected area networks. \nThe inclusion of these types of land use could open \na new discussion in which Central Africa can offer \nits experience. This also means not only discussing a \npurely accounting objective of 30% of the territories \nunder more or less strong protection, but also empha-\nsizing the reality of management on the ground \nand the effectiveness of management of all of these \nterritories, whether they are conventional protected \nareas or other priority land uses. It is on this point of \nmanagement effectiveness that the main discussions \nof the CBD should focus.\nOn the other hand, it would seem misguided to \nconsider the effectiveness of protected area networks \noutside their context. The issues of network connec-\ntivity and the separation or overlapping of land uses \nmust be considered within the framework of multi-sec-\ntoral land use planning.

Tourism also provides employ-\nment opportunities and helps finance community \nprojects in very poor rural areas, thereby helping to \nanchor protected areas and tourism activity in rural \nterritories. \nHowever, promoting local development means \nencouraging and supporting the emergence of small \nlocal initiatives and reception facilities, agricultural \nand craft production for visitors, etc.\n\nDocument 782: In several countries of the subregion, the States have \nsigned PPPs with private operators, foundations and \nNGOs for the management of protected areas as well as \nthe development of ecotourism (see Chapter\u202f3). Visitor \nfacilities, logistics and tourism products on offer have \nthus been greatly improved on certain sites. Despite the \ndifficulties, several \u00ad\nprofessional tourism companies are \nbeginning to establish themselves in Central Africa, \nmaking it possible to develop a higher quality, even \nluxury offer, which was lacking in the subregion.\nThe most dynamic area, and the first to attract \nhigh quality tourism operators, is the Albertine Rift \nwith its mountain gorillas. While Virunga National \nPark has several camps and lodges, it is mainly in \nRwanda that several private groups have invested \nin luxury accommodation and hospitality facilities \n(Wilderness Safaris, Governor\u2019s Camp, Mantis, etc.). \nVolcanoes National Park also offers a wide range of \naccommodation, from the most luxurious to the most \nbasic, that can meet all expectations.\nIn the Congo Basin, large hotel chains are present \nand tend to be concentrated in major cities (such as the \nRadisson group), but they are uninterested in the ecot-\nourism market. Companies specializing in this type \nof product are not yet well established in the region. \nThe Congo Conservation Company is an exception, \nhaving operated in North-Congo for the past ten years \nin Odzala-Kokoua National Park (see box). It has set \nup several luxury camps and plans further investments \nover the next 20 years, including in Nouabale-Ndoki \nPark (Magoum, 2020). CCC also has established \na partnership with Sangha Lodge in CAR, which \nalready allows it to offer cross-border tourism products \nin Sangha Tri-National (TNS). It thus plans to play a \ndriving role in the development of regional tourism, as \ndesired by the countries (protocol for the circulation of \ntourists in TNS; COMIFAC, 2019).\n\nDocument 787: These peri-urban protected areas \ncan play an important role in terms of environmental \nawareness and education.\nVarious small tourism operators already are \nworking around Volcanoes National Park, as well \nas in cities that have potential for business and \nfamily travel (such as Libreville, which can leverage \ntwo peri-urban parks). Other small tourism struc-\ntures requiring little investment also have emerged \nin Gabon within the framework of whale watching \ntourism, for which only a small boat is needed. \nHowever, these tourism structures (accommoda-\ntion, catering, tourist operators) are not or are only \nmarginally involved in tourism in protected areas. \nWhen they are, their skills and modes of operation \nare generally not in line with ecotourism standards.\nTourism activities in protected areas can be a \nmeans of enhancing skills and culture, providing \nincome for surrounding rural communities and \ndriving empowerment and emancipation. This could \nbe the case, in particular, for indigenous peoples, who \nare often marginalized. If, despite a more favorable \ntourism environment, tourism activities involving the \nBagyeli in the Kribi region continue to be dominated \nby other operators, the involvement of the Ba\u2019Aka in \nthe Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas (APDS) suggest \nways by which indigenous communities could be \nmore involved (see boxes).  \nHowever, challenges remain to be overcome, \nincluding raising awareness of the role of rural \ncommunities in tourism activities that are new \nto them, increasing their responsibilities and \nstrengthening their skills in tourism management \n(Tchindjiang & Etoga, 2014). The grip of the State \nand external private operators, and even interna-\ntional NGOs, on the design and decision-making \nprocesses related to tourism activities and land-use \nplanning hinders the effective involvement of rural \npopulations. While these national and international \noperators play a fundamental role, this role should \nevolve more toward one of support, supervision and \n\u00ad\noversight of local operators.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"distracting element","seed_document_id":839,"distracting_context":"227\nFigure\u202f4 - Evolution of the main transhumance routes between 1970 and 1990\nSource: FAO (2012).","topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

In 2012, an \norder by the minister in charge of mines prohibited \nillegal gold mining in protected areas in Cameroon, \nand made any gold mining activity in protected areas \nsubject to prior authorization by the administrations \nin charge of mines, forests and wildlife, environment \nand nature protection (MINMIDT, 2012). \nHowever, given the widespread presence of many \nartisanal gold miners in much of the country, from \nthe south up to Adamaoua, including in protected \nareas, it has been difficult to enforce this ministe-\nrial order (Noiraud et al., 2017). This is the case in \nthe inter-zones of the TRIDOM landscape, both in \nCameroon and Gabon.

However, cohabita-\ntion between artisanal diggers and semi-mechanized \nCameroonian companies, but also sometimes foreign \ncompanies (Korean, Chinese, South African, etc.), \nleads more often to conflictual relations than good \nintegration (Voundi et al., 2019); with sometimes very \nsignificant social and environmental impacts.\n\nDocument 689: It seems to have decreased in Gabon (Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 and periphery) following \nforceful action by the government. The area most affected is the Dja Faunal Reserve. The \narea around Ngoyla in Cameroon also has about 22 artisanal gold mining sites.\nA new, semi-industrial gold mining sector, often involving Chinese operators, is further-\nmore rapidly devastating large areas of land, mining gold in an uncontrolled manner (and \nremoving the gold that was the livelihood of artisanal gold miners) and heavily polluting \nrivers and springs. Despite government commitments to clean up the sector, a human and \necological disaster is underway.\nThe environmental impacts of these illegal practices are disastrous. They range from erosion \nto the diversion of watercourses through siltation (Tieguhong et al., 2009). This activity \ngenerates several impacts, including deforestation and forest degradation, ecosystem \npollution, poaching and fragmentation of wildlife habitats, alongside a deterioration in the \nliving and working conditions of the gold miners.\nArtisanal and semi-industrial gold mining needs to be effectively regulated and legalized to \nend the poaching associated with these mining sites and reduce pollution. This is particu-\nlarly true of mercury pollution, the effects of which on human and ecosystem health in the \nTRIDOM cannot currently be assessed. It is also a question of encouraging and reserving \ngold mining activities for national citizens, under the framework of a reorganization of the \ngold sales channels controlled by the States. \nIn Gabon, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Equatoriale des Mines (SEM), plans to support the creation of gold \nminer cooperatives. This state-owned enterprise was established a few years ago to oversee \nthe development of the mining sector and manage government holdings in mining projects. \nSEM plans to assist, train and equip gold miners so that they can engage in an activity \nthat will enable them to generate income over an extended period of time (Ondo Nzuey, \n2019). If this initiative becomes a reality, it could make it possible to formalize this activity \nto a certain extent, and to integrate consideration of environmental concerns. However, if \nimplemented, this experiment should be evaluated and its potential for \u00ad\nextension to other \nareas examined.\n\nDocument 659: This company\u2019s objec-\ntives will be to conduct mineral resource inventories in \npartnership with other actors, implement exploration \nand exploitation activities, ensure the restoration of sites \nafter exploitation and obtain stakes in all \u00ad\ncompanies \nwith links to the mining sector (S.A., 2020).\nHowever, these objectives have not yet been trans-\nlated into operational industrial projects due to a \nnumber of unfavorable factors (drop in mineral prices, \nCovid-19, opaque governance, etc.). For example, the \nfirst major cobalt-nickel-manganese mining claim, \nheld by the American company Geovic in southeast \nCameroon (Nkamouna), still has not yet seen the \nlight of day (Noiraud et al., 2017; Anon., 2021). \nAnother major undertaking intended to launch \nCameroon\u2019s industrial mining activity is the Mbal-\nam-Nabeba project, operated by Camiron and \nSundance Resources to exploit vast iron ore deposits \non the Cameroon-Congolese border. This project is \nassociated with the construction of a railway to the \nport of Kribi (about 550\u2009km).

This guide, which should be \nupdated with regard to recent technological develop-\nments in the mining sector, could also inspire reforms \nof laws governing the exploration and exploitation of \nmines and metals.\nThe real challenge facing Central African countries \nis the need to conciliate a desire to promote economic \ndevelopment on the one hand with the preservation of \nthe region\u2019s rich ecological and human heritage on the \nother. Governments must promote proactive policies \nthat integrate environmental and social concerns into \nall extractive activities in order to encourage mining \noperations that truly contribute to the sustainable \ndevelopment of their countries. This also means that \nboth effective incentive systems and credible control \nand penalty systems must be put in place.\n4.6 Promoting public-private \npartnerships for biodiversity conservation\nAs noted above, the nature of extractive indus-\ntries\u2019 operations can have very significant impacts on \nbiodiversity and the environment overall. Through \nenvironmental management plans based on environ-\nmental and social impact studies, extractive industries \ncommit to preventing, minimizing and repairing the \ndamage they may cause to the environment during \ntheir operations (the avoid-reduce-offset sequence). \nDespite their possible willingness to do so, mining \nand oil companies do not always have either the \ncapacity or experience to contribute to biodiver-\nsity conservation to an extent that could offset the \n\u00ad\nnegative impacts they may create.\nIt is therefore important to examine the possi-\nbility of promoting partnerships between extractive \nindustries, governments and NGOs or private \npartners working in the field of conservation. This \nis the case of traditional organizations such as \nWWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), IUCN and \nWCS (Wildlife Conservation Society), and more \nrecently established organizations such as African \nParks Network (APN). This type of Public-\u00ad\nPrivate \nPartnership (PPP) can effectively organize the \ncontribution of extractive industries to protected area \nmanagement and biodiversity conservation efforts \nthrough alliances between different stakeholders \nwith complementary skills and responsibilities. \nThe example of Shell in the Gamba protected area \ncomplex in Gabon is quite instructive in this regard \n(Dallmeier et al., 2006; Moussotsi Ikapi, 2016).","topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

Protected \nareas allow this reforestation dynamic to flourish. \nEncouraging forest regeneration and the restora-\ntion of land in protected areas that have been impacted \nin the past by human activities also enables signifi-\ncant amounts of carbon to be stored. This requires \nlooking beyond the boundaries of protected areas to \nunderstand their interactions with their surround-\nings.

These claims \naffect 18 protected areas. Contrary to what might \nbe expected with improved land use planning, these \nfigures have increased since 2012. At that time, the \ngovernment had granted 30 mining exploration \npermits in 12\u202fprotected areas, covering approximately \n9,400\u2009km2 (Schwartz et al., 2012). \nMost of the overlap areas involve prospecting \nmining permits (exploration). The main national \nparks affected are Lobeke, Boumba-Bek, Nki, \nCampo-Ma\u2019an and, to a lesser extent, Korup, in \nthe southern forest region. In the open woodlands \nand savannas of the north, Bouba-Njida and Benue \nparks are most affected. Also threatened are other \nsites that have not yet been classified but which are \nvery important for the conservation of Cameroon\u2019s \nbiodiversity, for example the Ngoyla-Mintom forest \nreserve and the Ebo forest. \nGovernment representatives have wanted to \nsubstantially develop the mining sector for several years, \nas shown by the creation of SONAMINES (National \nMining Company) in late 2020.

For example, the \nfirst major cobalt-nickel-manganese mining claim, \nheld by the American company Geovic in southeast \nCameroon (Nkamouna), still has not yet seen the \nlight of day (Noiraud et al., 2017; Anon., 2021).\n\nDocument 657: 3.4 Overlap of mining concessions \nand\u00a0protected areas\n3.4.1 Central Africa\nIn Central Africa, at least for seven of the ten \ncountries concerned, there are currently almost \n4,590 awarded mining contracts covering an area of \n502,150\u2009km2.

If mining claim applications \nare added, the total number of concessions overlap-\nping protected areas covers 4.6% of their surface. \nWhile mining claims overlap a much smaller part \nof protected areas compared to oil permits, it should \nbe noted that the impact of mines on biodiversity is \noften much greater than that of onshore oil wells, \nparticularly when the latter observe appropriate \nmeasures (Reed & Miranda, 2007; Dallmeier et al., \n2016; Noiraud et al., 2017). Moreover, it should be \nremembered that we are reporting here only official \nmining claims, and that illegal artisanal mining and \nsemi-artisanal mining are widespread, causing a great \ndeal of both ecological and social damage (De Failly, \n2013; Edwards et al., 2014). The specific situation in a \nfew countries is presented below.\n\nDocument 669: Although the government of Gabon is trying to \nformalize and legalize this sector, much remains to be \ndone (see box on this topic in section 3.6).\n3.4.4 DRC\nAs previously noted, DRC is \u201cthe\u201d mining country \nin the subregion. Currently, 194\u202fclaims overlap \nprotected areas, covering almost 14,000\u2009km2; these \nclaims affect 3.1% of protected area land (Table\u202f2). \nHowever, unlike Cameroon, these figures have been \ndecreasing for several years. In 2017, overlaps affected \nabout 11% of protected areas (Noiraud et al., 2017). \nDRC\u2019s economy is more heavily dependent on \nmining than any other country in the subregion, \nwhich can have dramatic social and environmental \nconsequences. The exploitation of minerals is fueling \nserious social conflicts, particularly in the eastern \npart of the country (Reed & Miranda, 2007; De \nFailly, 2013; AMDC, 2017). Artisanal mining is \ndeveloping extensively across the country\u2019s territory, \ninside and outside protected areas, with extremely \nlimited possibilities for control. The environmental \nconsequences are more damaging in the absence of \nany regulation. \nNumerous mining exploration claims have been \nawarded around and within protected areas, such as \nthe Okapi Wildlife Reserve and the national parks of \nUpemba, Virunga, and Maiko, among others;\u00a0several of \nthese protected areas are on the list of World Heritage \nsites. In Katanga, where copper and cobalt mining is \nthe main industrial activity, mining claims cover a large \npart of protected areas, such as the Basse-Kondo game \nreserve and the Lufira Biosphere Reserve (Noiraud et al., \n2017). The high concentration of mining companies \nleads to significant degradation of soils and ecosys-\ntems (savannas, dry forests, hydrographic network) \nand even to the loss of agricultural land. In some cases, \nthis mining also is leading to significant human health \nproblems (Kahilu Mutshima et al., 2015).\n\nDocument 656: 272\nMoreover, the projected allocation of new claims \npotentially threatens another quarter of the protected \narea network, bringing the total overlap to nearly half \nof the surface of protected areas in Central Africa \n(Figure\u202f7). A large proportion of the protected areas \nin Congo, Gabon, DRC and Chad would be threat-\nened (Table\u202f1). Apart from Sao Tome and Principe, \nno country is spared. \nAlthough under certain circumstances oil exploita-\ntion can considerably limit its environmental and social \nimpacts, and even prove to be a key player in sustain-\nable development, the environmental impacts of this \nexploitation could prove to be very negative, both on \nland and in the marine environment (Dallmeier et al., \n2016; Aghalino & Eyinla, 2017; Amarachi & Kabari, \n2020). On land, the strongest potential impacts of oil \nexploitation can be expected in swamp forests, which \nare more easily subjected to pollution (Ite et al., 2013). \nEverywhere, production and disposal infrastructure \nand indirect impacts will be significant, at least under \ncurrent conditions. During the exploration phase, the \ndestruction of forests also can cause significant impacts, \nparticularly if the soil is fragile, as is the case in coastal \nsedimentary basins (Doumenge, 1992).\n3.4 Overlap of mining concessions \nand\u00a0protected areas\n3.4.1 Central Africa\nIn Central Africa, at least for seven of the ten \ncountries concerned, there are currently almost \n4,590 awarded mining contracts covering an area of \n502,150\u2009km2.

In 2013, it started working under a PPP \nin Nouabale-Ndoki (Congo), a park in which it has \nbeen providing technical assistance since 1993.

It recently entered into \ntwo PPPs: one relating to Salonga National Park, \nin DRC (since 2015), and the second relating to \nthe Dzanga-Sangha complex of protected areas (a \nnational park and a special reserve) in CAR, where \nthe organization has operated since the 1980s.

These are: Forgotten \nParks in DRC (since 2017) and No\u00e9 in Conkoua-\nti-Douli National Park in Congo (finalization of \nnegotiations underway in 2020).\n2.2 Public-private partnerships  \nand law enforcement\nLaw enforcement is the task of protected area \nmanagers that has generally been seen as incom-\npatible with delegated management and has been\n\nDocument 251: For example, two NGOs, the World Wide Fund \nfor Nature (WWF) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) respectively have provided \nuninterrupted support to the protected areas of Dzanga-Sangha (CAR) and Nouabale-Ndoki \n(Congo) since the areas were established (in 1990 and 1993, respectively).  These two NGOs \nrecently negotiated to change their support from the project form to a PPP arrangement, and \ncontracts were signed to this end in 2013 (WCS) and 2019 (WWF).\nWhat difference does this make compared to long-term technical assistance? First, the \ncontract establishes official governance and operational management entities in the protected \nareas that did not necessarily exist previously. Through the contract, the State then formally \ndelegates part of its prerogatives to the private partner. This mainly concerns two domains: i) \nmanagement of protected area staff (including government employees), which passes under \nthe direct authority of a director representing the private partner; and ii) securing long-term \nfunding, which becomes the sole responsibility of the private partner. The last point is crucial: \ngiven the inefficiencies of Central African States in terms of financial governance, it is expected \nthat the credibility of the private partner will lead to substantial private and public funding and \nthat this partner will ensure efficient and transparent management.\nIt should be acknowledged that in the case of long-term technical assistance, the private \npartner already de facto provides and manages most of a protected areas\u2019 funding, and also \nsets up forms of shared governance of the protected area through one or several project \nsteering committees, for example.  In this case, the real novelty is above all the transfer of the \nresponsibility of the protected area\u2019s entire staff to the private partner.\nIn general, three key elements constitute a PPP:\n\t\n\u2013 There is a contractual document between the public and private partners that clearly defines \nthe roles, responsibilities and commitments of the two parties;\n\t\n\u2013 The public partner delegates to the private partner all or part of its prerogatives, in particular \nthe management of the protected area\u2018s staff (including government employees);\n\t\n\u2013 The private partner provides or raises funding and manages the funds necessary for the \noperational management of the protected area (investment and operations).\n\nDocument 241: Partnerships with private organizations have been \nsuggested to be a means to address the root causes, \ni.e., \u201cpoor incentives\u201d and \u201cunderfunding\u201d, as not-for-\nprofit organizations generally are distinguished by \ntheir technical expertise and credibility in the eyes \nof international funding agencies compared to often \nhighly centralized bureaucratic governmental organ-\nizations (Hatchwell, 2014; Saporiti, 2006; Baghai \net\u00a0 al., 2018; Scholte et al., 2018). Since the early \n2000s, protected area authorities in some 12 countries \nin sub-Saharan Africa have delegated park manage-\nment to international non-governmental private \npartners. While Malawi and Zambia led the way in \nSouthern Africa to adopt such partnerships, Central \nAfrican countries hesitated to embrace delegated \nmanagement to help restore their parks. Delegated \nmanagement has long been perceived as \u201callowing \nforeigners to take over our national parks\u201d. Doubts \nabout its feasibility and desirability continues to \nreign amongst protected areas authorities in Central \nAfrican countries, such as Cameroon and Gabon. \nIn 2005, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n(DRC) took the lead in Central Africa, contracting \nAfrican Parks Network (APN) for the management \nof Garamba National Park and Virunga Foun-\ndation for the management of Virunga National \nPark. Since 2010, the DRC has been joined by an \nincreasing number of Central African countries, \nsuch as Chad, Rwanda, Congo and Central African \nRepublic (CAR), which have initiated Public-\u00ad\nPrivate \nPartnerships (PPP) (Figure\u202f1). As of July 2020, \n13 partnerships have been contracted (the 14th at \nNyungwe National Park in Rwanda is imminent), \nmanaging a total area of c. 205,000\u2009km2, the size of \nSenegal.

With changes already noticeable in \nthe geographic distribution of diverse terrestrial and \naquatic organisms in response to global warming, \nlittle information exists on the direct links between \ninnate characteristics (including physiological traits, \nphysiological tolerance limits and genetic diversity) \nand the vulnerability of species to climate change \n(Root et al., 2003; Calosi et al.; 2008; Williams et al., \n2008; Pacoureau, 2018). \nOver the past 100\u202fyears, the global average temper-\nature has increased by approximately 0.714\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.18\u2009\u00b0C, \nand it is expected to continue to rise at a rapid rate \n(Pachauri & Reisinger, 2008; Welbergen et al., 2008). \nDuring periods of rapid climate change, taxa which \nare unable to change their geographic range are at \nparticular risk of extinction, especially if they cannot \nphysiologically compensate for variations in the envi-\nronment (Bradshaw & Holzapfel, 2001; Davis & \nShaw, 2001; Balany\u00e1 et al., 2006).\nAlthough they may not disappear immediately, \nthe populations of various species in Central Africa \ncould decline sharply under the impact of extreme \nclimate events.

Climate change will also alter \nthe flowering and fruiting capacity of vegetation, \nwith cascading effects on all of the species which \ndepend on it (Butt et al., 2015).

This \nis the case for the mining of gold and semi-precious \nstones (Noiraud et al., 2017). However, cohabita-\ntion between artisanal diggers and semi-mechanized \nCameroonian companies, but also sometimes foreign \ncompanies (Korean, Chinese, South African, etc.), \nleads more often to conflictual relations than good \nintegration (Voundi et al., 2019); with sometimes very \nsignificant social and environmental impacts.\n\nDocument 660: This will profoundly \nchange the accessibility of southern Cameroon (and \naccess to various protected areas), and also carries \nthe risk of potential land use conflicts with other \nindustrial forestry and agricultural projects (Noiraud \net al., 2017). As Sundance Resources was unable to \nstart the Mbalam project, Cameroon reportedly \ndecided to withdraw the permit and award it to a \nconsortium of five Chinese state-owned compa-\nnies; at the same time, the Congolese government \nalso awarded the Nabeba permit to a new company \n(Mbodiam, 2021).\nBefore a mining claim is granted, the mining \ncode requires prior approval from the relevant public \nauthorities, which allow mining operations to be \nconducted in and around national parks and protected \nareas subject to international agreements. In 2012, an \norder by the minister in charge of mines prohibited \nillegal gold mining in protected areas in Cameroon, \nand made any gold mining activity in protected areas \nsubject to prior authorization by the administrations \nin charge of mines, forests and wildlife, environment \nand nature protection (MINMIDT, 2012). \nHowever, given the widespread presence of many \nartisanal gold miners in much of the country, from \nthe south up to Adamaoua, including in protected \nareas, it has been difficult to enforce this ministe-\nrial order (Noiraud et al., 2017).

This activity \ngenerates several impacts, including deforestation and forest degradation, ecosystem \npollution, poaching and fragmentation of wildlife habitats, alongside a deterioration in the \nliving and working conditions of the gold miners.\nArtisanal and semi-industrial gold mining needs to be effectively regulated and legalized to \nend the poaching associated with these mining sites and reduce pollution. This is particu-\nlarly true of mercury pollution, the effects of which on human and ecosystem health in the \nTRIDOM cannot currently be assessed. It is also a question of encouraging and reserving \ngold mining activities for national citizens, under the framework of a reorganization of the \ngold sales channels controlled by the States. \nIn Gabon, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Equatoriale des Mines (SEM), plans to support the creation of gold \nminer cooperatives. This state-owned enterprise was established a few years ago to oversee \nthe development of the mining sector and manage government holdings in mining projects. \nSEM plans to assist, train and equip gold miners so that they can engage in an activity \nthat will enable them to generate income over an extended period of time (Ondo Nzuey, \n2019). If this initiative becomes a reality, it could make it possible to formalize this activity \nto a certain extent, and to integrate consideration of environmental concerns.

Several \nthousand people are engaged in gold panning or \nrelated activities (working as porters, gold buyers and \nsmall traders). Gold mining sites often are located \ndeep in the forest and can have a significant impact \non biodiversity, particularly the hunting of wildlife \nthat thus far have been left relatively undisturbed. \nThe supply chains serving mines are often used to \ntransport bushmeat and ivory. The mining camps \nsometimes shelter poachers and\/or ivory traders. \nTRIDOM and TNS are under threat from artisanal  \nand semi-industrial mining\nThe TRIDOM and Sangha Tri-National (TNS) transboundary complexes are under enor-\nmous pressure from illegal artisanal miners. In the southern part of the buffer zone of the \nCameroon segment of TNS, three artisanal gold mining sites have been established and \nare operating with impunity.

Trekking des gorilles.\n\nDocument 824: It is interesting to compare Odzala-Kokoua Park \nwith Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda (Table\u202f10). \nTourism is incomparably more developed there \ncompared to the protected areas of the Congo Basin \n(Table\u202f5). This is primarily due to mountain gorillas, \nwhich are the major tourism attraction (see Box 3.1), \nbut other tourism products also have been developed, \nsuch as hiking and cultural tourism (Baeriswyl, 2018). \nThis success is due to the efforts made in the park itself \n(infrastructure, protection, tourism management, etc.), \nthe fairly easy access to the park (good roads and relative \nproximity to Kigali), but also the policy implemented \nfor several years by the Rwandan government to place \ntourism among the key economic sectors. Tourism is \nnot considered separately from other economic sectors, \nbut rather as a driving force for the development of \nthe country as a whole. Rwanda also has taken a \nstrong position in the business and conference tourism \nsegment, with a very good MICE (Meetings, Incen-\ntive, Conferences, Events) ranking, which increases the \nattractiveness of the destination.\n5. National and international \ncrises\u00a0and tourism\n5.1 Safety and health impacts on \ntourism and protected areas\nBefore turning to the effects of the Covid-19 \npandemic, which has been raging since the beginning \nof 2020 (UNWTO, 2020c), it should be noted that \ntourism is an economic activity that is particularly \nsensitive to the destination\u2019s image on the one hand, \nand the local security and health context on the other, \nas the two are linked. Many examples have shown that \nthe number of visitors to a site drops drastically if there \nis a deterioration in the security situation. This unfor-\ntunately has repeatedly been the case in Virunga Park \n(DRC), but also in Cameroon\u2019s most famous park, Waza\n\nDocument 831: and an increase in human impacts (increased risk \nof poaching...; Kamga Kamdem et al., 2020; Lindsey \net al., 2020; Waithaka, 2020; Spenceley et al., 2021). \nOne of the most important impacts is the likely \ndecrease in revenue for protected area management \nand local communities, especially if cascading effects \nare likely to lead to a decrease in national and inter-\nnational funding for protected areas, or its redirection \nto the health sector or to address the financial crisis.\nIn Rwanda, an organized and proactive country, \nparks were open for part of the year, which helped to \nlimit losses. A rigorous process was put in place and all \nvisitors were required to present a negative Covid test, \nboth immediately prior to and upon arrival at the parks. \nGorilla tourism has been reopened, with revenues falling \nby less than in other countries, despite the drop in visits \nand lower rates for domestic visitors (Roberts, 2020).","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":862,"situational_context":"A passionate environmental activist is looking to gain more knowledge about the conservation efforts in the Forest protection and Conservation Area in Central Africa and Congo Basin.","topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

Could you tell me about some of the challenges that we might encounter in implementing national action plans for elephant conservation in Central Africa and the Congo Basin, particularly in terms of human-wildlife conflict resolution?","reference_answer":"The challenges in implementing national action plans for elephant conservation in Central Africa include a lack of political will, conflicts of interest, particularly with other ministries, and a lack of funding to roll out human-wildlife conflict programs.","reference_context":"Document 457: National action plans are important, however, \nto obtain political support. Guidelines do exist to \nelaborate national elephant plans and are currently \nbeing used to elaborate more national action plans \nin Central Africa. They have been more recently \nupdated in some countries (e.g., Gabon, Congo, etc.). \nThe elaboration of national strategies and action plans \nis often less of a challenge than the implementation \nof the activities recommended. This is due to a lack \nof political will and conflicts of interest, particularly \nwith other ministries, and a lack of funding to roll \nout human-wildlife conflict programs. Gabon is one \nexception with a detailed plan in human-elephant \nconflict that is put into practice (ANPN, 2016).\n3.6 Changing agricultural patterns \nOne of the most effective deterrence to elephant \ndamage is the modification of traditional agricul-\ntural patterns. This concerns the location of fields, \nplanting alternative \u2013\u202funpalatable\u202f\u2013 crops (Gross \net al., 2016), and potentially changing the planting \nstyle (e.g., moving from slash-and-burn to regularly \nfertilized fields). However, more research is needed \nto evaluate whether changing farming practices can \nbe an option. Overall, planting in wildlife habitats \nshould be avoided; if needed, farms must be relo-\ncated out of wildlife habitats and away from paths or \npotentially attractive features such as natural fruiting \ntrees. The closer the farms are located to the settle-\nment, the easier it is to guard them. Scattered small \nfields within wildlife habitats will lead to increased \ncrop raiding compared to large communal fields with \nstraight edges. Fields should be grouped together \nand a collaborative effort to guard them must be set \nup. Working together buffers the individual damage \ndone to a single farmer. Establishing teams that guard \nthe fields will also allow farmers to concentrate their \nefforts on farming and not guarding (see Table\u202f1).\n\nDocument 456: Activi-\nties that fall under such legislation include, for example, \nreactive actions such as translocations, killing of \nproblem animals, compensation and insurance, but also \nland-use planning. Within a country, there are often \nmultiple laws from different sectors (environment, \nforest, wildlife, agriculture) that must be considered \nwhen dealing with human-wildlife conflict. \nFew countries have detailed laws providing a legal \nframework of dealing with wildlife conflict animals \nand compensations. For instance, Rwanda enacted \na law on the compensation of damage caused by \nwildlife (Law N\u00b026\/2011 of 27\/07\/2011) and estab-\nlished the Special Guarantee Fund for accidents \nand damage caused by vehicles and wildlife (Law \nN\u00b052\/2011 of 14\/12\/2011).\nElephants are totally protected in all Central \nAfrican countries. But the killing of elephants, for \nexample for trophy hunting, is allowed in some coun-\ntries. Trophy hunting has unknown consequences on \nelephant populations, particularly when large tuskers \nare removed (as there is often a minimum size of tusks \nto be allowed to be hunted). \nMost national and regional strategies and action \nplans to assist in the conservation of forest elephants \nare largely outdated and date back to 2005 (IUCN, \n2015). National action plans are important, however, \nto obtain political support. Guidelines do exist to \nelaborate national elephant plans and are currently \nbeing used to elaborate more national action plans \nin Central Africa. They have been more recently \nupdated in some countries (e.g., Gabon, Congo, etc.). \nThe elaboration of national strategies and action plans \nis often less of a challenge than the implementation \nof the activities recommended. This is due to a lack \nof political will and conflicts of interest, particularly \nwith other ministries, and a lack of funding to roll \nout human-wildlife conflict programs. Gabon is one \nexception with a detailed plan in human-elephant \nconflict that is put into practice (ANPN, 2016).\n3.6 Changing agricultural patterns \nOne of the most effective deterrence to elephant \ndamage is the modification of traditional agricul-\ntural patterns.\n\nDocument 491: 207\nTaking into consideration elephant needs within \na landscape is much more challenging as we have \nlittle understanding about their seasonal movements. \nDetailed knowledge on wildlife behavior (where avail-\nable) needs to be included in such planning and zoning \nexercises as in the case of savanna elephants (Graham \net al., 2009; Granados et al., 2012; Bastille-Rousseau \net al., 2020; Snyder et al., 2020). For example, we must \nconsider the wide-ranging nature of forest elephants \nand particularly the explorative behavior of younger \nmale elephants.\nSettlements and farms should not be created along \nknown elephant paths, close to natural forest clearings \n(bais) and salt licks and should not disturb migration \ncorridors to seasonal available fruiting trees. Any \nplanning should model how potential habitat changes \nand losses of high conservation value forest impact \nforest elephant distribution.\nThe success of any planning exercise will be based \non a government\u2019s commitment. Too often, we have \nseen that existing land-use plans are not respected and \nare not included in legislation and policy. Despite the \nexistence of inter-ministerial exchange committees, the \ndifferent ministries often do not consult each other, \nresulting in land use overlaps; mining concessions are \noverlapping with protected areas and\/or large oil palm or \ntimber concessions are attributed without consultation \nof relevant stakeholders (Javelle, 2012; Schwartz et al., \n2012). Improvement of the legal framework related to \nland-use planning and reforms is currently taking place \nin some and is starting in other Central Africa coun-\ntries. This is particularly important as Central Africa is \nundergoing rapid changes due to major development \ncorridors, and the building of infrastructure for mining \nand timber operations, as well as large scale agricultural \nand palm oil \u00ad\nproduction in the near future.\n5. Conclusion\nHuman-wildlife conflict is undoubtedly one of \nthe main threats to conservation in Central Africa, \nalong with the destruction of habitats and the \ncommercial hunting of wildlife to supply markets \nwith \u00ad\nbushmeat. It is a real challenge for governments, \nwildlife managers, conservation and development \norganizations and local communities.\n\nDocument 490: Integrating human-wild-\nlife conflict programs into such an approach is \nconsidered as one of the greatest long-term activities \nto increase human-elephant co-existence (Osborn & \nParker, 2003; Dublin & Hoare, 2004; Walker, 2010; \nFairet, 2012). Such an exercise will involve the input of \nmany stakeholders with the aim to protect key forest \nelephant habitats and natural resources while simulta-\nneously considering people\u2019s needs for space to secure \ntheir livelihoods. Protecting key areas for elephants, \ncreating buffer zones, and investing in alternative land \nuses can be some of the successful solutions.\nLarge landscapes will allow natural movements \nof forest elephants, allowing them to use more space \nwhich will reduce locally high elephant numbers and \npotentially extreme conflict zones. Identification and \ncreation of wildlife corridors between high density \nzones, such as protected areas or high conservation \nvalue forest within logging concessions, is of crucial \nimportance in this land-use exercise. This planning \nconcerns elephants that move out of isolated protected \nareas and come into conflict with riverine commu-\nnities and farms in the vicinity of the protected area \nborder. In that case, land-use planning including wide \nbuffer zones (e.g., planted with unpalatable crops \nsuch as medical herbs or chili) can be an option. For \nexample, a buffer zone with forest plantations (euca-\nlyptus and acacia) and tea plantations has been set up \naround Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":457,"situational_context":"A land-use planner from Gabon is seeking information about established forest elephant conservation strategies and human-wildlife conflict resolution examples in Central Africa and Congo Basin.","topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

Indirect or hidden impacts include the opportunity costs of added expenditures and workload, such as staying up overnight to protect crops, which can lead to lack of sleep, increased stress, and poorer health. There can also be poor nutritional status, and children might not be able to attend school if they must work overnight to protect the farms or if an elephant blocks the roads. Additionally, there are intangible costs which are non-monetary, temporally delayed, and often psychological in nature, such as fear, stress, sleep deprivation or in extreme cases, grief over a death.","reference_context":"Document 431: Conflict events may thus affect people for \nyears after they occur.

They range from activities that aim to \nprevent human-wildlife conflict before it occurs to \nmitigation measures that aim to reduce the impacts \nof human-wildlife conflict after it occurs (Nelson \net al., 2003; Redpath et al., 2013; Nyhus, 2016; Young \net al., 2016a; K\u00f6nig et al., 2020). Thus, in the case of \nelephants, it is not only crucial that we fully under-\nstand the ecology of forest elephant behavior to \nmodify their behavior (Mumby & Plotnik, 2018), \nwe also need to acquire a clear understanding of the \nhuman dimension of the conflict (Dickman, 2010; \nBennett et al., 2017a; Hill, 2017; Wallace & Hill, \n2017; Gross, 2019; Shaffer et al., 2019).\n\nDocument 430: Researchers and \u00ad\ntourists have \nbeen killed by hyper aggressive male elephants and \nelephant mothers protecting their young offspring.\nForest elephants can also be dangerous to people \nwhen approaching settlements. When elephants lose \nfear, they come near people and become destructive \n(see above). Elephants can prevent people from passing \nand might actively charge people. This can substantially \ncompromise conservation efforts. In order to anticipate \nany aggressive behavior, it is strongly recommended \nthat people be aware of the risks of charging elephants \nand understand their body language.\n2.4 Opportunity costs\nHuman-elephant conflict also generates oppor-\ntunity costs, poor health and poor nutritional status \n(Fairet, 2012; Walker, 2012; Barua et al., 2013; \nGladman et al., 2020). Staying up overnight to protect \ncrops leads to an increased workload, lack of sleep and \nmore stress, lower health and a rising fear of elephant. \nChildren might not be able to attend school if they \nmust work overnight to protect the farms or if an \nelephant blocks the roads and prevents them from \npassing. Conflict events may thus affect people for \nyears after they occur. We will see below that such \nintangible costs strongly influence tolerance for \nco-existing with wildlife.\n2.5 Price increase and standard of\u00a0living\nCrop raiding can also have secondary impacts on \npeople not involved in the farming sector as prices \nof cash crops can be higher in remote villages where \nlocal production cannot meet demand for staple foods \n(Fairet, 2012; Walker, 2012). For example in Northern \nCongo, cassava had to be imported (despite being \nsubsidized by a nearby conservation project), and the \nprice was up to 25% higher in villages where elephants \nhad destroyed almost all crops (Nsonsi, n.d.).\n3. Finding solutions \nto human-elephant conflict\nMeasures to address human-wildlife conflict are \ndiverse and address different elements of the conflict.\n\nDocument 426: Impacts can be either direct (crop loss, \nproperty destruction, injury, etc.) or more hidden, such \nas the opportunity costs of added expenditures and \nworkload (Hoare, 2000a; Hill, 2004; Jadhav & Barua, \n2012; Walker, 2012; Barua et al., 2013; Gladman et al., \n2020; Salerno et al., 2020).\nAnother way to categorize these costs is to split \nthem into tangible and intangible categories (Kansky \n& Knight, 2014). Tangible costs are financial losses \nsuch as infrastructure and harvests damages, whereas \nintangible costs are non-monetary, temporally \ndelayed, and often psychological in nature (fear, stress, \nsleep-\u00ad\ndeprivation or in the extreme case grief over a \ndeath). To be successful, a human-elephant conflict \nprogram must consider both monetary and intangible \ncosts as they are likely to have different types of influ-\nence on peoples\u2019 perceptions and levels of tolerance \nfor co-\u00ad\nexistence. Here we briefly describe some of \nthe major impacts that forest elephants can have on \npeople and their livelihoods.\n2.1 Crop raiding\nCrop raiding is often mentioned as being \nrespon\u00ad\nsible for the largest (monetary) impact of \nhuman-wildlife conflict on human livelihoods \n(Naughton et al., 1999; Mackenzie & Ahabyona, \n2012; Hill, 2018). In Central Africa, it predomi-\nnantly impacts individually managed smallholder \nfarms using slash-and-burn practices (Lahm, 1996; \nMadzou, 1999; Naughton et al., 1999; Boukoulou \net al., 2012a; Eyebe et al., 2012; Fairet, 2012; Walker, \n2012; \u00ad\nInogwabini et al., 2014; Nsonsi et al., 2017). \nCrop raiding is likely to have occurred ever since \nthe existence of \u00ad\nagriculture in Africa. Most people\n\nDocument 425: 181\n2. Types of human-elephant \nconflict and impact on livelihoods\nElephants and people compete for space, water and \nfood. Rural human population growth results in an \nexpansion of agricultural land and a reduction of forest \nelephant habitat. Due to their large body size, enormous \nnutritional needs (up to 450\u2009kg of food per day), and \nwide-ranging behavior, forest elephants regularly come \ninto conflict with humans (Fritz, 2017). Elephants are \nparticularly notorious crop raiders, and their ability \nto destroy an entire year\u2019s worth of crops in a single \nvisit can threaten a\u00ad\n \u00ad\nfarmer\u2019s livelihood. Elephants are \nmessy eaters and can easily destroy around one hectare \nof crops in a few raids. When we address conflict due \nto forest elephants, it is therefore important to know \nthat a single elephant can cause huge damage. Thus, it \nis not surprising that forest elephants are considered \namong the top-ranking crop-raiding species, which \nlikely leads to declining tolerance for elephants in rural \n\u00ad\ncommunities (Naughton-Treves & Treves, 2005).\nIn addition to damaging crops, they destroy food \nstores and water sources, and sometimes threaten \nhuman life. Impacts can be either direct (crop loss, \nproperty destruction, injury, etc.) or more hidden, such \nas the opportunity costs of added expenditures and \nworkload (Hoare, 2000a; Hill, 2004; Jadhav & Barua, \n2012; Walker, 2012; Barua et al., 2013; Gladman et al., \n2020; Salerno et al., 2020).\nAnother way to categorize these costs is to split \nthem into tangible and intangible categories (Kansky \n& Knight, 2014). Tangible costs are financial losses \nsuch as infrastructure and harvests damages, whereas \nintangible costs are non-monetary, temporally \ndelayed, and often psychological in nature (fear, stress, \nsleep-\u00ad\ndeprivation or in the extreme case grief over a \ndeath).","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":431,"situational_context":"An inhabitant of a remote village in Northern Congo is interested in learning about measures to reduce the impacts of human-elephant conflict, given the rising crop loss caused by elephants' raiding.","topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

This sanctuary needs to be revitalized through financial and technical \nsupport to restore the confidence of the Mboko Alengui community and enable them to \nreclaim the future of the site. While a minimum of financial resources is required, support \nto local communities is particularly important in terms of institutions, governance, manage-\nment and planning, the resumption of the habituation of gorilla groups and the revival of \ntourism activities. The community cannot face all of these challenges alone.\n\nDocument 192: 81\nLossi Gorilla Sanctuary (Congo): current governance\nN. Gami, Consultant anthropologist\nAn original and innovative story\nIn northern Congo spanning 350\u2009\nkm2, the Lossi Gorilla Sanctuary lies in the south of the \nOdzala-Kokoua National Park. Between 1992 and 1997, a lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla \ngorilla) habituation experiment took place, supported by Central African Forest \u00ad\nEcosystems \nprogram (ECOFAC), funded by the European Union (Gami, 2003).\nThe site chosen covers clan lands of the Mboko Alengui communities. These have a very \nstrong sense of land ownership, managed by the rights holders. Hence, rules based on \ncustomary law set out the terms of inheritance or land appropriation by individuals. The \ngorilla habituation pilot experiment, in interaction with foreign researchers and with the \nsupport of an anthropologist, led to the creation in Congo, for the first time, of a protected \narea at the request of the local community owning the land (1996).\nThis local community is explicitly involved in the management of the gorilla sanctuary, \nincluding decision making and the sharing of revenues generated by ecotourism. The \nmodalities of participation - a first in Congo - are specified in Decree No. 2001-222 of \n10\u202fMay 2001, establishing the sanctuary (Articles 3 and 11). Article 11 stipulates in particular: \n\u201cA memorandum of understanding sets out the forms of involvement of the local commu-\nnity, the partnership model to be put in place and the nature of the benefits derived by the \nvillage communities in the management of the sanctuary\u201d.\nWhat has become of this pilot experiment in the Congo?\nUnfortunately, following the devastating effects of the Ebola epidemics, the communities \nnow feel abandoned. Indeed, in December 2001, the first Ebola hemorrhagic fever epidemic \nin the Congo broke out in the Districts of Mbomo and Kell\u00e9. Several more outbreaks followed \nuntil 2005, resulting in the deaths of more than 80 local people, as well as gorillas and chim-\npanzees (OMS, 2021).\n\nDocument 191: This creates an asymmetrical relationship between \nthe two partners from the outset, which can hinder \ncollaboration; nevertheless, these challenges could \nbe overcome if the official authority is proactive in \nsharing governance.\nElsewhere, particularly in DRC, local commu-\nnities also have been behind the emergence of \nprotected areas, such as the Yiondje Bonobo \nCommunity Reserve, which came into existence \nin 2012 after several years of work. As in the case \nof Lossi, the government conservation agency \n(ICCN) is the official manager. However, collabo-\nrative governance was set up thanks to La For\u00eat des \nBonobos Association, created by and for the commu-\nnities. This association also is supported by two \ninternational organizations, the African Wildlife \nFoundation (AWF) and the Wamba Committee \nfor Bonobo Research (WCBR). Another shared \ngovernance reserve, Sankuru Nature Reserve, the \nlargest bonobo reserve in DRC, continues to expe-\nrience heavy deforestation that is endangering the \nclosest relative to humans. These problems appear \nto be a result of insufficient support and partici-\npation on the part of local communities as well as \n\u00ad\nunresolved land conflicts (Volckhausen, 2019).\nIn the Luki (DRC) and Dimonika (Congo) \nbiosphere reserves, WWF promoted the establish-\nment of shared governance systems. This process \nhas lasted several years and has demonstrated the \nimportance of a protocol to which all stakeholders\n\nDocument 190: 80\nAmong the benefits brought by the implemen-\ntation of shared governance, there is a reduction \nin the workload between actors, an increase in the \nskills of the various stakeholders, and a sharing and \nunderstanding of each other\u2019s perspectives, etc. In \nterms more directly of conservation, synergy between \ngovernment representatives and local stakeholders \ncan help create alliances to address unsustainable \nexploitation of natural resources by entities outside \nthe protected area (Borrini-Fayerabend et al., 2010). \nHowever, this assumes that parties involved can get to \nknow each other, work together, and develop a shared \nvision for the future of the protected area.\nAmong the protected areas under official shared \ngovernance between the State and rural communities, \nthe Lossi Gorilla Sanctuary is a precursor in Central \nAfrica (see box). It is the first protected area created \nby official decree at the request of local communities - \nthe Mboko Allengui communities. Under Congolese \nlaw, as in other countries, the administration in charge \nof protected areas (ACFAP) holds the governance and \nmanagement power. The decree provides for a form \nof partnership (to be defined) with the communities, \nwhich could theoretically allow for shared govern-\nance. However, the communities are only involved \nin governance at the pleasure of the administration. \nThis creates an asymmetrical relationship between \nthe two partners from the outset, which can hinder \ncollaboration; nevertheless, these challenges could \nbe overcome if the official authority is proactive in \nsharing governance.\nElsewhere, particularly in DRC, local commu-\nnities also have been behind the emergence of \nprotected areas, such as the Yiondje Bonobo \nCommunity Reserve, which came into existence \nin 2012 after several years of work.

Certain oil companies may be less sensitive to environmental issues and the risks of pollution are higher in wetland areas. Much of the mining sector operates illegally and is largely unconcerned by the environmental and social impacts of extraction activities. In Central Africa, there are currently almost 4,590 awarded mining contracts covering an area of 502,150 km2. These mining claims largely spare the Central Congo Basin but occupy extensive land in two major geographic zones: the South Congo - Gabon - Cameroon axis, and the landscape and ancient lands bordering the Congo Basin, mainly in the east (Albertine Rift) and south (Kasai and Katanga plateaus).","reference_context":"Document 683: 286\nMining claims overlap only marginally with \noil and gas contracts; when added up, the total \narea affected by extraction permits actually reaches \nmore than 60% of IFLs. While oil claims could, \nin some cases, be managed to limit environmental \nimpacts (Dallmeier et al., 2006; Moussotsi Ikapi, \n2016), there is considerable concern that this will \nnot be the case in the Central Congo Basin or \nwith mining claims. Certain up-and-coming oil \ncompanies may be less sensitive to environmental \nissues than some of the sector\u2019s leading players, and \nthe risks of pollution are higher in wetland areas \n(Ite et al., 2013; Le Bec, 2020a). Furthermore, \nmuch of the mining sector operates illegally and \nis largely unconcerned by the environmental and \nsocial impacts of extraction activities (Le Billon \n& Hocquard, 2007; Edwards et al., 2014; Lopez \net al., 2017).  The danger of deforestation and forest \ndegradation remains very\u00a0high.\nLastly, comparing extraction claims with IFLs as a \nwhole is not sufficient because Central African forests \nare far from homogeneous, with some containing \nabove-average biological richness or rare and endan-\ngered species. These forests are indeed very diverse, \nboth in terms of plant and animal composition and \nfunctional composition (Fayole et al., 2014; Gond \net al., 2016; Marshall et al, 2021). The regions most \nimpacted by mining claims, such as eastern DRC and \nthe Gabon-Cameroon region, are also the richest in \nbiodiversity among Central African forests, and hold \nmany endemic species (Edwards et al., 2014; Dagal-\nlier et al., 2019). The environmental impacts of mining \nactivities may be more damaging in these regions than \nin some of the Congo Basin\u2019s terra firma forests.  \nFigure\u202f14 \u2013 Overlap between mining, logging and protected areas  \nin the TRIDOM landscape \nSources: OFAC and WWF-SIGHT.\n\nDocument 656: 272\nMoreover, the projected allocation of new claims \npotentially threatens another quarter of the protected \narea network, bringing the total overlap to nearly half \nof the surface of protected areas in Central Africa \n(Figure\u202f7). A large proportion of the protected areas \nin Congo, Gabon, DRC and Chad would be threat-\nened (Table\u202f1). Apart from Sao Tome and Principe, \nno country is spared. \nAlthough under certain circumstances oil exploita-\ntion can considerably limit its environmental and social \nimpacts, and even prove to be a key player in sustain-\nable development, the environmental impacts of this \nexploitation could prove to be very negative, both on \nland and in the marine environment (Dallmeier et al., \n2016; Aghalino & Eyinla, 2017; Amarachi & Kabari, \n2020). On land, the strongest potential impacts of oil \nexploitation can be expected in swamp forests, which \nare more easily subjected to pollution (Ite et al., 2013). \nEverywhere, production and disposal infrastructure \nand indirect impacts will be significant, at least under \ncurrent conditions. During the exploration phase, the \ndestruction of forests also can cause significant impacts, \nparticularly if the soil is fragile, as is the case in coastal \nsedimentary basins (Doumenge, 1992).\n3.4 Overlap of mining concessions \nand\u00a0protected areas\n3.4.1 Central Africa\nIn Central Africa, at least for seven of the ten \ncountries concerned, there are currently almost \n4,590 awarded mining contracts covering an area of \n502,150\u2009km2.

The impact of mines on biodiversity is often much greater than that of onshore oil wells, particularly when the latter observe appropriate measures.","reference_context":"Document 683: 286\nMining claims overlap only marginally with \noil and gas contracts; when added up, the total \narea affected by extraction permits actually reaches \nmore than 60% of IFLs. While oil claims could, \nin some cases, be managed to limit environmental \nimpacts (Dallmeier et al., 2006; Moussotsi Ikapi, \n2016), there is considerable concern that this will \nnot be the case in the Central Congo Basin or \nwith mining claims. Certain up-and-coming oil \ncompanies may be less sensitive to environmental \nissues than some of the sector\u2019s leading players, and \nthe risks of pollution are higher in wetland areas \n(Ite et al., 2013; Le Bec, 2020a). Furthermore, \nmuch of the mining sector operates illegally and \nis largely unconcerned by the environmental and \nsocial impacts of extraction activities (Le Billon \n& Hocquard, 2007; Edwards et al., 2014; Lopez \net al., 2017).  The danger of deforestation and forest \ndegradation remains very\u00a0high.\nLastly, comparing extraction claims with IFLs as a \nwhole is not sufficient because Central African forests \nare far from homogeneous, with some containing \nabove-average biological richness or rare and endan-\ngered species. These forests are indeed very diverse, \nboth in terms of plant and animal composition and \nfunctional composition (Fayole et al., 2014; Gond \net al., 2016; Marshall et al, 2021). The regions most \nimpacted by mining claims, such as eastern DRC and \nthe Gabon-Cameroon region, are also the richest in \nbiodiversity among Central African forests, and hold \nmany endemic species (Edwards et al., 2014; Dagal-\nlier et al., 2019). The environmental impacts of mining \nactivities may be more damaging in these regions than \nin some of the Congo Basin\u2019s terra firma forests.  \nFigure\u202f14 \u2013 Overlap between mining, logging and protected areas  \nin the TRIDOM landscape \nSources: OFAC and WWF-SIGHT.\n\nDocument 656: 272\nMoreover, the projected allocation of new claims \npotentially threatens another quarter of the protected \narea network, bringing the total overlap to nearly half \nof the surface of protected areas in Central Africa \n(Figure\u202f7). A large proportion of the protected areas \nin Congo, Gabon, DRC and Chad would be threat-\nened (Table\u202f1). Apart from Sao Tome and Principe, \nno country is spared. \nAlthough under certain circumstances oil exploita-\ntion can considerably limit its environmental and social \nimpacts, and even prove to be a key player in sustain-\nable development, the environmental impacts of this \nexploitation could prove to be very negative, both on \nland and in the marine environment (Dallmeier et al., \n2016; Aghalino & Eyinla, 2017; Amarachi & Kabari, \n2020). On land, the strongest potential impacts of oil \nexploitation can be expected in swamp forests, which \nare more easily subjected to pollution (Ite et al., 2013). \nEverywhere, production and disposal infrastructure \nand indirect impacts will be significant, at least under \ncurrent conditions. During the exploration phase, the \ndestruction of forests also can cause significant impacts, \nparticularly if the soil is fragile, as is the case in coastal \nsedimentary basins (Doumenge, 1992).\n3.4 Overlap of mining concessions \nand\u00a0protected areas\n3.4.1 Central Africa\nIn Central Africa, at least for seven of the ten \ncountries concerned, there are currently almost \n4,590 awarded mining contracts covering an area of \n502,150\u2009km2.

The success of certain ZICs is due to the efforts private hunting company staff, \nwho at least partially monitor these territories (Scholte & Iyah, 2016).

In addition, wildlife assessments are \nconducted in them every five years (Booth and Chardonnet, 2015; Roulet, 2007).\nOne of the difficulties in classifying hunting areas as protected areas is the diversity of \ntheir status, governance and management (see also Table\u202f5, Chapter\u202f2).

Examples include the \nimplementation of the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan for \nBiological Diversity adopted by the signatory parties \nto the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), \nAichi Target 11 and the Paris Agreement (2015). \nWith the signing of the Paris Agreement, govern-\nments decided to strengthen the global response to \nclimate change, with the aim of limiting the increase \nin global average temperature to below 2\u00b0C above \npre-industrial levels. \nTo achieve this objective, as advised by the Inter-\ngovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; \nGIEC, 2018), various scientists recommend reducing \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 \nand achieving neutral emissions (offset by capture) \nby 2070. Considerable international efforts will be \nrequired to achieve this as figures unfortunately reveal \na sustained rise in emissions, including in the areas \nof agriculture, forestry, and more broadly, land use \n(Shukla et al., 2019). \nAlthough fossil fuel use and industrial processes \naccount for nearly 80% of greenhouse gas emissions \n(GIEC, 2018), increasing attention is being paid \nto agriculture and forestry due to their combined \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation potential. \nIPCC recently addressed the issue of land use and \nthe measures to be implemented in this area, which \ninclude reducing deforestation, the reforestation and \nrestoration of land and ecosystems, changing land \nmanagement methods such as agroforestry, better fire \nmanagement, long-term integration of organic coals \nin soils, and improving livestock management\u00a0(Shukal \net al., 2019). All of these measures, combined with \nenergy efficiency and an increase in the share of green \nenergy in the energy mix, represent today the first \nsteps toward sustainable development.\n\nDocument 925: 385\n385\n4.1 Challenges of mobilizing funds \nfor\u00a0protected areas \nStrengthening the importance of protected \nareas in political agendas\nThe main actions supported by the Global Climate \nFund in Central Africa concern clean energy produc-\ntion projects (solar) and some land-use planning \nand reforestation projects (GCF, 2020a). These two \nsectors illustrate the key elements of strategies to fight \nclimate change, with on the one hand the promotion \nof low-carbon development (low-carbon economies, \ndeployment of \u201cgreen\u201d energies) and, on the other, \ncarbon storage (maintaining and increasing stocks). \nProtected areas are important land management \ntools that can be used to halt deforestation and the \nreduction of carbon stocks. They promote long-term \ncarbon storage and increased stocks in areas where \nforests are regenerating. Moreover, protected areas \nmake it possible to develop actions for the adapta-\ntion of human communities to climate change, as \ndiscussed earlier (section 1). Policy makers remain \nlargely unaware of these different roles, which are not \nsufficiently considered in sustainable development \nand land-use planning policies. It is COMIFAC\u2019s \ntask to act as an ambassador, with support from \nOFAC and all conservation partners.\nTo be socially acceptable, efforts to combat \nclimate change must first be understood as neces-\nsary and useful for the development of countries \nand their inhabitants. This involves communicating \nto the general public, but also, in a more targeted \nmanner, to policy makers and private operators. \nThese efforts also must support the sustainable \ndevelopment of countries and contribute to poverty \nreduction (Eba\u2019a Atyi et al., 2015a and b; Reyniers \net al., 2016), including in landscapes where protected \nareas are located. \nIf fighting against climate change is to be effec-\ntive, this concern also must be integrated into \nsectoral policies and requires improvements in \nintersectoral institutional coordination (energy, \nmining, forestry, agriculture, environment, etc.; \nHeller & Zavaleta, 2009). This will require major \nchanges in \u00ad\ndecision-making and management \nmechanisms, often involving a complete break with \ncurrent practices.\n\nDocument 53: 19\nrainfall, \nsupporting \nagricultural \nsystems \nand \ncombating climate change (see Chapter\u202f9), opportu-\nnities for economic activities exist in ecotourism (see \nChapter\u202f8) and in the development of Non-Timber \nForest Product (NTFP) industries. Protected areas \nare now the backbone of policies and strategies for \nbiodiversity conservation and sustainable manage-\nment. Over the past decade, the global protected area \nnetwork has increased steadily, both on land and at \nsea, including in Central Africa (Doumenge et al., \n2015a; UNEP-WCMC, 2018). This increase has \nhelped mitigate the effects of climate change and \nthe accelerating rate of species extinction (WWF, \n2020; IPBES, 2019).\nSome progress has been made in the implementa-\ntion of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, \nbut it remains insufficient (CDB, 2020). Protected \nareas will be at the heart of the negotiations of the \nnew post-2020 global biodiversity framework to be \ndiscussed at the 15th Conference of the Parties of the \nConvention on Biological Diversity (COP15-CBD). \nOne of the key measures is to protect at least 30% \nof the world\u2019s land and marine areas, with at least \n10% under so-called \u201cstrict\u201d protection (CDB, 2019). \nHow can Central African protected areas contribute \nto this new global dynamic of biodiversity protec-\ntion and preservation of ecological balances? And \nhow are protected area managers in the subregion \nresponding to some of the challenges facing them? \nThis Chapter\u202fattempts to answer this twofold ques-\ntion; other more detailed answers also are provided in \nthe thematic chapters of this book.  \n1.\n\nDocument 865: 354\n354\nAlthough protected areas cover nearly 15.3% of the world\u2019s land area, including \ninland waters (Maxwell et al., 2020), their role in fighting climate change \nremains insufficiently understood. They contribute substantially to optimizing \ncarbon sequestration and storage by preventing deforestation and degradation \nof land and forest cover (Zapfack et al. 2013 and 2016; Noumi et al. 2018); \nthe\u00a0conservation of forests furthermore helps to maintain rainfall and regulate \nwater flows and local and regional climates (Makarieva et al., 2009; Nogherotto \net al., 2013; Bell et al., 2015; De Wasseige et al., 2015; Molina et al., 2019). \nProtected areas also shelter many species of animals and plants and provide a \nrange of ecosystem goods and services to human societies (Stolton et al., 2015). \nHealthy, undisturbed ecosystems enhance resilience to the effects of climate \nchange, and enable ecosystems and human populations to mitigate and\u00a0adapt \nto these changes (De Wasseige et al., 2015; Eba\u2019a Atyi, et al., 2015a). \nAlthough they face multiple pressures, the overall \nhealth of natural ecosystems in Central Africa remains \ngood. The Congo Basin forest is the second largest \ncontinuous tropical forest track after the Amazon. \nIt contains one of the world\u2019s largest national forest \nparks, Salonga National Park, located in the Demo-\ncratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Protected areas \nin the subregion are home to unique biodiversity, one \nwhich remains rich, and highly diversified ecosystems \n(Doumenge et al., 2015). \nThe dense humid forests of Central Africa \ncontain the highest amount of biomass per unit area \n(418.3\u202f\u00b1\u200991.8\u2009\nT\/ha) of all tropical forests, and thus \nstore significant amounts of carbon (Saatchi et al., \n2011; Slik et al., 2013). They contribute substan-\ntially to climate equilibrium at local, regional and \ncontinental levels.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"What role do protected areas play in combating climate change?","answer":"Protected areas contribute substantially to optimizing carbon sequestration and storage by preventing deforestation and degradation of land and forest cover.

SAGE has two objectives. The \nfirst is to enable actors at the site level to \nimprove governance and equity in their \ndaily work to conserve biodiversity and \npreserve the environment. The second \nis to generate information for actors at \nhigher levels to monitor the effective \nmanagement of protected areas, improve \ngovernance and produce national reports. \nInitially developed for protected areas, \nits use has been extended to other sites \nand conservation areas for sustainable \nnatural resource management. The \nassessment is based on a framework \nof 10 principles of effective and \nequitable governance in line with IUCN \nprotected area governance principles. \nIt is generally not recommended to use \nthe full set of 10 principles because \nexperience has shown that summarizing \nthe findings will take more than a \nfull day\u2019s work and participants may \nlose interest in the proceedings. \nSupervised by SAGE \nfacilitators, site-level actors \nand rights holders conduct \nthe assessment themselves \nin close collaboration with \nprotected area conservation \nservices.\n\nDocument 171: The SAPA methodology has helped to improve the \nquality of the information collected and the owner-\nship of the process by the communities who also wish \nto take their destiny into their own hands. Consul-\ntation of all the stakeholders, including conservation \nservices and local communities, is particularly useful \nfor sharing costs and benefits, disseminating informa-\ntion, promoting dialogue and shared reflection. The \nimportance of a transparent flow of information (who \ngets what) also was emphasized.\nIn addition to SAPA, other assessment tools \ninclude IMET (Integrated Management Effectiveness \nTool) and the Site-level Assessment of Governance \nand Equity (SAGE; see Chapter\u202f4). One of the lessons \nlearned from the use of these tools is the importance of \nclear identification and \u00ad\nparticipation of all stakeholders. \nOnly then can negotiations lead to the development \nand joint validation of solutions to the problems \nencountered in the governance of protected areas. \nIn general, the more effective the participation of \nlocal communities in decision-making processes, the \nbetter their input into the development of policies \nrelevant to their own development and accountability. \nIt also appears that programs intended to strengthen \nthe governance of protected areas in order for them \nto gradually become autonomous (economic, social, \necological and institutional sustainability), should \nbe designed to operate for approximately ten years \nrather than the three years planned for most projects \n(UICN-PACO, 2012).\n\nDocument 341: IIED \n(International Institute for Environment and Devel-\nopment) also has developed a consolidated approach \nsupported by an IT tool called SAPA (Social Assess-\nment for Protected and conserved Areas; Franks & \nSmall, 2016), which is intended to assess the social \nimpacts \u2013\u202fpositive or negative\u202f\u2013 of protected areas \nand any related conservation or development activity.\nWidely used and recognized systems do not yet \nexist for the assessment of governance. However, \nseveral tools are currently under development or \nare being tested in the field. These include GAPA \n(Governance \nAssessment \nfor \nProtected \nand \nconserved Areas, Frank & Booker 2018), SAGE \n(Site-level Assessment of Governance and Equity), \nand the IMET module for assessing the governance \nof ecosystem services which is currently being tested \nin some protected areas in the subregion.\nTools for assessing the management effectiveness \nof protected areas deserve particular attention given \ntheir importance for supporting sound protected area \nmanagement. Over 70 methods and tools are listed \nin the GD-PAME. Among those most used in the \nfield, including in Central Africa, we may mention \nthe following:\n\u2022\t EoH (Enhancing our Heritage), which was specif-\nically designed for UNESCO (United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organiza-\ntion) to assess the management effectiveness of \nWorld Heritage sites;\n\u2022\t RAPPAM (Rapid Assessment and Prioritization \nof Protected Areas Management), developed by \nIUCN, which helps to compare the management \neffectiveness of different protected areas;\n\u2022\t METT, which allows a rapid assessment of the \nmanagement effectiveness of a given protected area \nbut which is not suitable for inter-site compari-\nsons like RAPPAM;\n\u2022\t IMET, which is specifically designed to support \ndecision-making by managers.\nAmong these tools, the integrated tools combine \nelements for monitoring management effectiveness, \ngovernance, and social assessment. This is the case for \nIMET and IUCN\u2019s Green List of protected areas. \nThese tools are particularly interesting insofar as they \nallow a much more comprehensive view of a situa-\ntion and, therefore, directly and effectively support \ndecision-making processes through a planning-\u00ad\nmonitoring-evaluation approach.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"What is the objective of the SAPA tool?","answer":"Within the framework of poverty reduction for communities living in and around protected areas, SAPA enables the assessment of the positive and negative social impacts of protected areas on the well-being of these communities."},{"question":"What is the purpose of the SAGE tool?","answer":"SAGE is a method used to assess the governance and equity of measures to conserve biodiversity, ecosystem services and other actions to support conservation, such as cost-benefit sharing programs."}],"seed_document_id":400,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

In reality, \nshared governance was developed in the PPP frame-\nwork with international actors, but has been slow \nto take shape with rural communities. Despite the \ncommitments made by governments, many protected \nareas are still under government governance (85%),or \nhave government representatives on their governance \nbody (almost 100%).

The process \nrelated to the creation of protected areas has not taken this reality into account, \nthus carrying within itself the seeds of separation between humans and nature \n(Monpetit, 2013). Consequently, rural communities often have been excluded from \nthe decision-making processes and the management of protected areas as well as \nthe\u00a0resources they relied on to survive. From being the managers of their environment, \nmost local inhabitants have been relegated to the status of observers. Meanwhile, \nstate, private and non-governmental actors exercised their rights over these lands. \nOver time, protected areas have been created and, with them, new institutions.\nDespite the continued growth of protected area \nnetworks in Central Africa, as well as efforts to \nimprove the performance of these protected areas, \nthey do not always achieve the objectives set out. \nPoaching and other anthropogenic pressures continue. \nTo respond effectively to these challenges, it is key \nto improve the governance of protected areas.

By effective inclusive \nparticipation, we mean that government institu-\ntions, local communities, the private sector and civil \nsociety are involved in decision-making processes in \na manner that is transparent and accountable to all \nrelevant stakeholders.\nThis chapter aims to show that the governance \nof protected areas in Central Africa is undergoing a \nprofound change, while also at a crossroads between \nconsolidation and continuous improvement in some \ncountries, and hesitation and resistance in others.\n\nDocument 218: 92\nand skills), requires an in-depth rethinking of the \ntraining system so that it becomes more participatory \nand applied, with a carefully planned pedagogical \nprogression, adapted to local contexts (see the descrip-\ntion of the Tayna reserve initiative in section 4.1). \nFinally, continuous training targeted to the needs of \nmanagers and other personnel must be implemented, \nalong with plans to help skills progress. \n7. Conclusion\nIn Central Africa, we have seen that the govern-\nance systems of protected areas are complex, based \non complex interactions between institutional \nstructures and actors with divergent and overlap-\nping interests and norms. Over the past thirty years, \nthese systems have evolved significantly, although \nin different ways. Public governance is now leaning \nmore towards governance by an independent agency \nrather than a ministerial department. Shared govern-\nance has developed but mainly in the framework \nof public-private partnerships with international \norganizations. The sharing of responsibilities with \nlocal communities is being tested in various sites \nbut is still in its infancy. Finally, one protected area \nwith private governance and two with community \ngovernance were identified.\nThus, the governance of protected areas in the \nsubregion is undergoing profound change. Central \nAfrica is now at a crossroads in finding the right \ngovernance model reflecting the realities of  the variety \nof human and ecological contexts. Although there is \nstill a long way to go, in some cases it is increasing \nwelfare and social equity for people and significantly \nreducing threats and pressures on protected areas. \nWhat appears to be a fundamental condition \ntoday is the pursuit of reforms within governance \nsystems so that they match local contexts. Given \nthe considerable weight of traditional customs and \npractices and the esteem in which the institution of \ntraditional chieftaincy is held, as well as the dogma \nof religion within communities bordering protected \nareas, it is desirable that reform action be put in place \nto make traditional norms more compatible with the \nrequirements of modern governance of protected \nareas (Bigombe Logo, 2012; Kwesi, 2007).\n\nDocument 178: In other cases, such as the \nLake Tele Reserve in Congo, governance is officially \nin the hands of the public authority, but an entire \nset of structures and procedures have been put in \nplace to effectively involve local communities in \n\u00ad\ndecision-making (see boxes in section 4.2). All of \nthis is a first step towards officially shared govern-\nance, or even governance that could eventually be \ndelegated to rural communities.\nThe assessment made here corresponds mainly \nto terrestrial protected areas, which were the first \nhistorical models established. Marine protected areas, \nwhich are more recent, also have appeared in Central \nAfrica since the end of the 1990s. While the govern-\nance of terrestrial protected areas is evolving towards \nmore inclusive models, marine protected areas are all \nunder public governance, thus limiting the possible \nparticipation of users of the maritime space.\n4.2.

Isolated protected areas where elephants primarily range inside protected areas and sometimes move out of them. 2. Large relatively intact forest landscape and protected area networks where forest elephants move freely. 3. Human dominated multi-use landscapes, dominated by agricultural land and large commercial plantations, where there is a conflict of interest between farmers and those who wish to protect the remaining elephant populations. The increase in human-elephant conflicts has been caused by the expansion of commercial logging, mining activities and development corridors, the development of infrastructure and roads, and encroachment from people coming from outside these landscapes. This has resulted in an intensification of farming, more sedentary settlements, and shorter fallow periods, causing an expansion of agricultural areas into forest elephant habitats.","reference_context":"Document 416: The conflict situation and potential mitigation \nmeasures differ according to the intactness of the land-\nscape, which can be put into three broad categories: \n1.\tIsolated protected areas: elephants primarily \nrange inside protected areas and from time to time \nmove out of them, for example to raid crops on \nland surrounding the protected area. There is often \na hard edge between the protected area border and \nthe surrounding land which is largely due to the \nfact of encroachment by people resulting in the \nisolation of \u201cisland\u201d protected areas.

In this \ncontext, protected areas are often falsely blamed for \nbeing responsible for conflict, whereas stakeholders \n(e.g., logging companies) responsible for wildlife \nmanagement in the land outside of protected areas \nare not doing enough to address the conflict. This \ncategory is applicable to the largest intact land-\nscapes in Western Equatorial Africa and is largely \nrelevant to wide-ranging species, such as elephants, \nmigratory herbivores, and large carnivores;\n3.\tHuman dominated multi-use landscapes, domi-\nnated by agricultural land and large commercial \nplantations: such situations are increasingly occur-\nring in Central Africa (Asaha & Deakin, 2016). \nHere, elephants are rare, and there is a conflict of \ninterest between farmers and those who wish to \nprotect the remaining elephant populations.\nFurthermore, it should be noted that many \nhuman-wildlife conflict studies and manuals mainly \nconcentrate on mitigation measures. However, these \ntechnical activities only treat the symptoms of the \nproblem (Barnes, 2002; Dublin & Hoare, 2004; \nHoare, 2015; Gross, 2019). The conflict lies at various \nlevels, and different activities going beyond miti-\ngation are needed to address conflict issues among \n\u00ad\nstakeholders and the underlying and deep-rooted \ncauses of conflict in order to transform conflict into \nco-existence (Madden & McQuinn, 2014, 2017; \nNyhus, 2016; Frank et al., 2019).\nIn the following, we cover three objectives and \nprovide various recent case studies related to human-\nforest elephant conflict. First, we briefly summarize \nthe history and current situation of human-elephant \nconflict in Central Africa. We next describe the types \nof human-elephant conflict and discuss the impacts \non human livelihoods. Finally, we propose a holistic \napproach to addressing human-elephant conflict that \nintegrates both biological and social science methods \nto the complex issues of human-elephant conflict.\n\nDocument 421: With the creation of many protected areas in \nthe 1990s and increasing measures of \u00ad\nconservation, \nforest elephants eventually returned close to human \nsettlements and started raiding crops in the villages \nwhere they were well protected. Around these \nvillages, protection measures were relatively well \nimplemented due to the presence of conserva-\ntion actors. Consequently, forest elephants started \nto range even closer to human settlements, where \nthey felt safe and where crops were easily acces-\nsible. Complaints of human-\u00ad\nelephant conflict have \nbeen increasing ever since. Today, forest elephants \nstill occur in relatively moderate numbers in the \ndense rain forests of Gabon, Congo, and Southeast \nCameroon, as well as in and around Salonga National \nPark in the DRC (Maisels et al., 2013). Most other \npopulations are fragmented and have undergone \ndramatic declines due to commercial poaching for \nivory, which has caused a population decline of over \n60% (and in some sites even over 80%) over the last \ndecade (Maisels et al., 2013; N\u2019Goran et al., 2016; \nPoulsen et al., 2017).\nHistorically, the largest landscapes had excep-\ntionally low human population densities with \nrelatively intact forests where forest elephants could \nroam freely. However, this has changed rapidly over \nrecent decades due to the expansion of commercial \nlogging, mining activities and development corri-\ndors (Edwards et al., 2014; Laurance et al., 2015; \nKleinschroth et al., 2019). The development of \ninfrastructure and roads, and encroachment from \npeople coming from outside these landscapes, has \nled to a mixture of people of varying origins and \nsocio-economic backgrounds, and an intensifica-\ntion of farming, more sedentary settlements, and \nshorter fallow periods.\n\nDocument 422: Historically, the largest landscapes had excep-\ntionally low human population densities with \nrelatively intact forests where forest elephants could \nroam freely.

Overall, protected area management in Central \nAfrica reflects a top-down conservation strategy in \nwhich locals are mostly excluded from decision making. \nHowever, authorities in charge of managing protected \nareas in Central Africa have limited technical skills \nand financial means.

Perceptions can reflect past \nconflictual events and not necessarily current conflict. \nNegative perceptions towards wildlife can result from \npast confrontations with wildlife laws (e.g., with \nrangers) and consequently some wildlife species, in \nparticular forest elephants, are perceived as the main \nconflict species (Fairet, 2012; Nsonsi et al., 2018). \nSometimes local people, including farmers, even \nthreaten conservationists and park managers because \nwildlife destroyed their properties, including fields. \nFor instance, if an elephant kills a farmer near a \nprotected area, this may result in a massive protest \nagainst the protected area\u2019s administration, some-\ntime resulting in the burning of staff offices and \ncars. Clearly, such deep-rooted attitudes and polit-\nical manipulation have often been ignored in local \nconservation projects. Indeed, intangible costs have \nbeen identified as having a much larger impact on \ntolerance of living with wildlife like elephants and \nbuffaloes than the perceived monetary costs or lack of \nbenefits from their conservation.\n\nDocument 180: Traditional \nrights of ownership and management of territories \nthat existed prior to the creation of protected areas \nwere not taken into account. This historical form \nof governance often favors legal and institutional \ntools of repression and eviction of populations. As \na result, conflicts between conservation officers and \nlocal communities are recurrent (see Chapter\u202f1). \nHowever, this conflictual situation is not inevitable \nand it is possible to establish more inclusive govern-\nance. Some Central African countries have chosen \nto adopt a government-led governance system that \nstill leaves room for consultation, aiming to better \nintegrate communities and improve management \nefficiency. This is notably the case in DRC and \nCongo, although actions towards better shared \ngovernance also are being undertaken elsewhere.\nIn some cases, managers have established mech-\nanisms for conflict resolution and collaboration with \nlocal communities, as in Nyungwe National Park in \nRwanda. The administration there promotes envi-\nronmental information and education, develops joint \nmechanisms for managing conflicts between commu-\nnities and the park (illegal activities and animals \nleaving the park), and allocates 10% of the income \ngenerated from tourism in the park to socioeconomic \nprojects chosen jointly by district representatives, park \nofficers and sector officers. Consultation frameworks \nbetween the administration and the communities \nhave been set up to provide adequate responses to \nconflicts arising from illegal activities in the protected \narea. Park authorities maintain partnerships with local \norganizations as well as private investors to establish \nperformance contracts related to the implementa-\ntion of projects that preserve the integrity of the park \n(Hakizumwami, 2016). Although under the jurisdic-\ntion of the State, the welfare of local communities \nis part of the conservation actions. Since October \n2020, Nyungwe Park has switched to a new mode \nof governance, under a PPP contract with the NGO \nAfrican Parks, which is committed to continuing \nthese actions.\nElsewhere, administrations and their partners are \ngoing even further in sharing governance.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"Why do conflicts often occur between local people and protected area managers?","answer":"Conflicts between local people and protected area managers are common due to a lack of local community participation in the management of protected areas, and occasionally poor relationships between local people and protected area managers."},{"question":"What strategies have been implemented to manage conflicts and improve relationships between protected area managers and local communities?","answer":"Some managers have established mechanisms for conflict resolution and collaboration with local communities.

Understanding these factors is crucial to design crop protection methods and mitigate human-wildlife conflicts.","reference_context":"Document 445: 189\n3.2.4 Other social and cultural conflicts\nThere are also conflicts between farmers. For \ninstance, some farmers accuse their neighbors of \nwitchcraft and of transforming themselves into \nelephants to destroy their plantations because, by \nchance, an elephant feeds in one field and leaves the \nneighboring fields untouched (Nsonsi, n.d.). The \nowner of the destroyed field takes a negative view of \nthe luckier ones. \nPerceptions are likely to differ due to people\u2019s \nethnic and residency background (Parathian et al., \n2018). Clearly pygmies, who have a strong spiritual \nlink to elephants, have different attitudes than \nBantus (K\u00f6hler, 2005). Many Bantu tribes believe \nthat elephants are totems of the Aka\/Baka pygmies \nwho want to punish them by annihilating their \nefforts in the agricultural sector. And more impor-\ntantly, immigrants are likely to show less tolerance \ncompared to people that have grown up with \nelephants living nearby. \nThus, an understanding of the perceptions of those \nwho are affected by the conflict is crucial as their \nbeliefs are likely to influence their behavior (Nsonsi \net al., 2018).

Crop raiding behavior is likely \ndifferent due to differences in wildlife habitats (e.g., \navailability of water, location of fruiting patterns). \nFor instance, there are differences between elephants \nspecies (e.g., savanna elephants move in large herds \nwhile forest elephants tend to form small groups; \nFishlock et al., 2008; Schuttler et al., 2012; Schuttler \net al., 2014; Turkalo et al., 2013; Fishlock & Turkalo, \n2015; Mills et al., 2018; Beirne et al., 2020; Brand \net al., 2020), and differences in farming patterns \n(mainly small-scale farms in forest areas compared \nto larger fields in the savannas). In addition, it is \nimportant to realize that each location has its own set \nof factors affecting the spatial and temporal pattern \nand intensity of crop raiding, and hence the different \noptions available to mitigate the conflict. While there \nis a deepened understanding of some of the factors \naffecting the vulnerability of farms to crop-raiding \nelephants in savanna ecosystems, little is known about \nforest elephants.\n\nDocument 439: 186\n3.2 Perceptions and root causes \naffecting tolerance of co-existence \nwith\u00a0forest elephants\nConservation programs aiming to mitigate the \nimpacts of human-wildlife conflict must under-\nstand the social dimensions of the conflict because \nhuman-wildlife conflict is often mainly about social \nconflicts between different human groups (Hill, 2004; \nDickman, 2010; Hill, 2017; Wallace & Hill, 2017; \nVucetich et al., 2018). Negative impacts on livelihoods \n(and tangible costs) often are far less of a problem \nthan the pervasive existence of negative perceptions \namong stakeholders (Hill, 2004; Webber et al., 2007). \nSuch data should take into account that the percep-\ntion of conflict wildlife can differ between households \nand according to a variety of socio-economic factors \nsuch as gender, level of education, ethnicity, residency, \ndependency on farming and wealth (Naughton et al., \n1999; Hill, 2004; Naughton-Treves & Treves, 2005; \nKansky & Knight, 2014; Nsonsi et al., 2017, 2018).\n3.2.1 Addressing lack of knowledge and \nconsidering local attitudes\nFirst, it is important to understand that local people, \nand occasionally even members of wildlife authori-\nties in Central Africa, have limited knowledge about \nthe management of human-wildlife conflicts. State-\nments such as the \u201cwildlife that come from the nearby \nprotected area\u201d often are incorrect because wildlife are \nnot confined (in most cases) to protected areas and \noften have been living in the landscapes long before the \nestablishment of human settlements and agriculture. \nNext, the size and behavior of the crop-raiding \nspecies strongly influences perceptions; for example, \nattitudes towards elephants are often based on \nextreme damage events which contrast with the small \npersistent damage caused by smaller animals such as \nrodents or insects (Hill, 2004; Naughton-Treves & \nTreves, 2005; Oerke, 2006; Arlet & Molleman, 2007).\n\nDocument 437: 185\ninvestigate conflicts between people, even though the \nconflict with wildlife might often be a surrogate for a \n\u00ad\ndeeper-rooted social conflict.\nProblems can be very site specific and depend on \nthe socio-cultural context of the stakeholders as well \nas the ecological setting in the landscapes or around \nthe concerned protected area. Furthermore, it is \nimportant to understand whether the human-ele-\nphant conflict concerns a larger portion of the human \nand elephant populations or just a few problem \nelephants or concerned farmers. Thus, understanding \nsusceptibility to and determinants of human-\u00ad\nelephant conflict requires a deeper \u00ad\nknowledge of \nsite-specific conflict patterns, especially crop raiding, \nwhich is likely to change over time as elephants \nquickly adapt to new situations. There are various \ndimensions of vulnerability, including biophysical, \nsocial and institutional components, and investi-\ngating these components together is likely to reveal \na much better understanding than \u00ad\ninvestigating a \nsingle factor on its own.\nIt is important to know that forest elephants have \nalways been present in these landscapes. They have \nnot been re-introduced, nor have they been forced \nout of protected areas due to growth in the elephant \npopulation. It is a misconception that more signs of \nhuman-elephant conflict are due to an increasing \nforest elephant population resulting from successful \nlaw enforcement activities as forest elephants show \nslow population recovery (Turkalo et al., 2017). \nConflict between elephants and people arises due to \nthe expansion of human settlements and slash-and-\nburn agriculturel, which are encroaching on elephant \nhabitats, and to elephants moving to areas where \nthey feel safe. Increasing habitat loss and fragmen-\ntation due to development of linear infrastructure, \n\u00ad\nexpansion of human settlements and people\u2019s need for \nland, agriculture and pastures are resulting in a serious \nincrease in human-wildlife conflict zones throughout \nthe continent (Kleinschroth et al., 2019).\nPoaching has worsened the situation on various \nlevels.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"What are some of the social and cultural conflicts related to elephants in Central Africa?","answer":"There are conflicts between farmers, some accusing their neighbors of witchcraft and transforming into elephants to destroy their plantations.

All of these elements must be \ntaken into account in protected area management \nplans, which are strategic tools essential for the \nmanagement of the sites. These plans must extend \nover several years and be reviewed at the end of \nthis period for possible improvements. They must \nthen be translated into annual management plans, \n\u00ad\nbusiness plans and other operational documents.\nThe 2015 edition of the State of Protected Areas \nin Central Africa carried out an initial country-\nby-country review of the status of protected area \nmanagement plans in the subregion (Doumenge \net al., 2015a). Since 2016, the IMET (Integrated \nManagement \nEffectiveness \nTool) \nassessments \nconducted, while covering only a sample of protected \nareas, nevertheless have noted a failure to produce \nnew or updated management plans. On the contrary, \nthere are an increasing number of development plans \nthat have not been updated. This could be one reason \nfor the decline in management effectiveness in many \nprotected areas.\nMoreover, the production of management plans \nappears to be motivated by a government adminis-\ntrative need and is not fully embraced by managers. \nMany development plans are not based on useful or \nup-to-date information.\n\nDocument 378: COMIT \u2013 BIOPAMA \nCampaign 2016.

Although a great deal of funding is \ncurrently being mobilized globally to fight climate \nchange, Central African protected areas have \nbeen largely overlooked by projects and programs \nsupported by climate finance.\nThe traditional funds mobilized, for example, \nwithin the GEF financing framework or by certain \nNGOs and international organizations, fall far short \nof protected areas\u2019 funding needs. REDD+ projects \ndeveloped in the subregion, particularly in the DRC, \nhave not yet met expectations despite the significant \ninvestments made. The projects need to be better \nanchored by promoting more participatory govern-\nance and by clarifying land tenure and local use rights \n(Reynier et al., 2016).  Other avenues also should be \nexplored, such as the Gabon-CAFI \u00ad\nagreement and \ngreater use of the GCF.   \nTo conclude, our analysis indicates that it is abso-\nlutely crucial to:\n1.\u202fintensify the consideration of climate change \nin the day-to-day management of Central African \nprotected areas. On one hand, the impacts of climate \nchange in Central African protected areas need to be \nbetter understood, and measures for their mitigation \nidentified; on the other, protected area managers \nneed to be trained in these domains;\n2.\u202fseize the opportunity offered by green finance to \nincrease financial and technical resources to improve \nthe management of protected areas in Central Africa \nthrough the development and implementation of a \nstrategy to mobilize green finance in their favor.\nCOMIFAC should play a major role in the \nimplementation of these actions with the help of its \ntechnical and financial partners.\n\nDocument 925: 385\n385\n4.1 Challenges of mobilizing funds \nfor\u00a0protected areas \nStrengthening the importance of protected \nareas in political agendas\nThe main actions supported by the Global Climate \nFund in Central Africa concern clean energy produc-\ntion projects (solar) and some land-use planning \nand reforestation projects (GCF, 2020a). These two \nsectors illustrate the key elements of strategies to fight \nclimate change, with on the one hand the promotion \nof low-carbon development (low-carbon economies, \ndeployment of \u201cgreen\u201d energies) and, on the other, \ncarbon storage (maintaining and increasing stocks). \nProtected areas are important land management \ntools that can be used to halt deforestation and the \nreduction of carbon stocks. They promote long-term \ncarbon storage and increased stocks in areas where \nforests are regenerating. Moreover, protected areas \nmake it possible to develop actions for the adapta-\ntion of human communities to climate change, as \ndiscussed earlier (section 1). Policy makers remain \nlargely unaware of these different roles, which are not \nsufficiently considered in sustainable development \nand land-use planning policies. It is COMIFAC\u2019s \ntask to act as an ambassador, with support from \nOFAC and all conservation partners.\nTo be socially acceptable, efforts to combat \nclimate change must first be understood as neces-\nsary and useful for the development of countries \nand their inhabitants. This involves communicating \nto the general public, but also, in a more targeted \nmanner, to policy makers and private operators. \nThese efforts also must support the sustainable \ndevelopment of countries and contribute to poverty \nreduction (Eba\u2019a Atyi et al., 2015a and b; Reyniers \net al., 2016), including in landscapes where protected \nareas are located. \nIf fighting against climate change is to be effec-\ntive, this concern also must be integrated into \nsectoral policies and requires improvements in \nintersectoral institutional coordination (energy, \nmining, forestry, agriculture, environment, etc.; \nHeller & Zavaleta, 2009). This will require major \nchanges in \u00ad\ndecision-making and management \nmechanisms, often involving a complete break with \ncurrent practices.\n\nDocument 898: 371\n371\nthe results obtained and to provide more answers to \nthe concerns of protected area managers in Central \nAfrica. To this end, the use of global circulation \nmodels (Zakari et al., 2017) and the vulnerability \nindex developed by NatureServe to assess the vulner-\nability of species of interest seems promising \n(Gendreau, 2016; Young et al., 2016).\n3. Financing Central African \nprotected areas in the fight against \nclimate change\nAlthough they play an undeniable role in the fight \nagainst climate change, protected areas in Central \nAfrica also are suffering the effects of climate change \n(see sections 1 and 2 of this chapter). In an interna-\ntional context where decision-makers, scientists and \nother stakeholders recognize the relevance of nature-\nbased solutions to today\u2019s environmental challenges, \nthe role of protected areas remains insufficiently \nacknowledged. However, this role should and must \nbe strengthened. \nIn addition to the various sources of funding avail-\nable to protected areas (Joyeux & Gale, 2010), carbon \ncould add value to biodiversity conservation activi-\nties. The value of carbon storage should be considered \nas one of the criteria for determining support for \nexisting protected areas and the boundaries of new \nprotected areas (Kemeuze, 2015). It is important to \nnote that the capacity for carbon sequestration and \nstorage increases rapidly when degraded areas have \nbeen restored. These elements may enable protected \nareas to potentially access funds allocated for both \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation. For this, \nit is necessary to include in strategies concerning \nprotected areas their carbon storage function and \ntheir key role in reducing emissions from deforest-\nation and ecosystem degradation. This implies \nregularly evaluating these elements and adjusting the \nmanagement of protected area networks, not only \naccording to biodiversity conservation objectives, but \nalso those of combating climate change.\nThe financing mobilized at the international \nlevel to combat climate change, as well as payment \nmechanisms for environmental services, could make \nit possible to improve and maintain the contribution \nmade by Central African protected areas to fighting \nclimate change.\n\nDocument 928: 386\n386\n4.2 Putting in place and operationalizing \na strategy to mobilize green finance \nfor\u00a0protected areas\nRelying on domestic financing to attract \nother investment\nProtected area networks are important both in \nsupporting sustainable national development and \nin contributing to strategies for populations to cope \nwith climate change. As such, governments have a \nduty to finance them, and there is hope that their \ninvestments will increase in the coming years, as \ncan already be seen in countries such as Gabon (the \nbeneficiary of a ground-breaking agreement with \nNorway) and Rwanda (a major GCF beneficiary, \nsee Figure\u202f7). This is expected to encourage inter-\nnational donors to provide more substantial support.\nConsidering the question from another angle, \nthese protected areas play a role that goes beyond \nnational borders, and they help to combat climate \nchange, with their efforts benefiting countries that \nare sometimes located far from Central Africa. It is \ntherefore appropriate that the international commu-\nnity contribute to their operations and effectiveness. \nUnder the aegis of COMIFAC, several countries \nin the subregion have begun a process of preparing \nnational strategies for the sustainable financing of \nprotected areas (see section 3.1). These documents will \nenable them to make better use of current sources of \nfinancing and to access financing that continues to be \ninsufficiently tapped in Central Africa. This should, for \nexample, make it possible to increase the contribution \nof the Green Climate Fund and mobilize a range of \nfinancial mechanisms other than the market mecha-\nnisms advocated by REDD+ (Eba\u2019a Atyi et al., 2015b). \nSeveral obstacles to mobilizing additional \nfunding for protected areas have been highlighted in \nthe past, including the lower debt-carrying capacity \nof Central African countries compared to coun-\ntries in the Americas or Asia.\u00a0This translates into a \nlower financial volume as well as a higher propor-\ntion of grants relative to loans (Liboum et al., 2019). \nHowever, several countries in the subregion have \nsignificant mining and energy resources and could \neasily reverse this trend.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"Let's consider the role of protected areas in the context of climate change."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":934,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

This encroachment is a consequence of the communities\u2019 poverty, as well as their resistance to the creation of protected areas. Another type of conflict is between humans and wildlife that approach villages and devastate crops. These conflicts are exacerbated by factors such as prevailing insecurity in the subregion and in neighboring countries, and the abusive behavior of some eco-guards toward local and indigenous communities.","reference_context":"Document 111: This issue is discussed in detail in Chapter\u202f5. \nThe territories around protected areas also are \naffected by conflicts related to access to land. The \ninadequate management of land issues is mainly due \nto a lack of knowledge on the part of land-use plan-\nners of the complexity of local dynamics of natural \nresource exploitation (Binot & Joiris, 2007).\nThese conflicts are exacerbated by other factors, \nsuch as the prevailing insecurity in the subregion and \nin neighboring countries, and the abusive behavior \nof some eco-guards toward local and indigenous \ncommunities. Cases of physical abuse, torture, confis-\ncation of fresh meat, extrajudicial executions and \ndestruction of property have been reported by human \nrights organizations.\n6.2 From conflict to collaboration  \nThe recognition that the exclusion of local and \nindigenous communities from protected areas was \nineffective has led States to seek a management \napproach that would allow for effective biodiver-\nsity conservation and the economic development of \nstakeholders (Moukouya et al., 2015). This approach \nwas at the heart of the ECOFAC program as well as, \nmore recently, that of the PPPs signed between States \nand various partners (see Chapter\u202f3).\nBefore establishing a protected area, an obvious \nfirst step would be to gather information about the \npeople who live there and how they live, and to \nreceive their consent (see box section 4), to ensure \nthat conservation restrictions do not threaten their \ntraditional livelihood activities. However, as a study \nof 34 protected areas has shown (Pyh\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2016), \nthis is almost never done in most Central African \ncountries, or if it is, it is carried out incompletely.\n\nDocument 110: This situation \nis due to several mechanisms, such as: a glaring lack \nof planning for national development and the sharing \nof national wealth; impoverished rural populations, \npartly displaced from the protected territory and who \nexpress their determination to exploit it; productive \nsystems \u2013\u202fin particular agricultural systems\u202f\u2013 that \nare not very productive combined with population \ngrowth; and external economic operators, individual \nor organized as a company, who come to carry out \nactivities in and around the protected areas.\n6.1 The origin of conflicts\nDifferent kinds of situations crystallize conflicts \naround protected areas. They can be linked to the very \ncreation of the protected areas, which often is accom-\npanied by the forced displacement of communities, \nas well as the plundering of their natural resources. \nIn particular, protected areas are the site of tensions \naround access to wildlife, from which the \u00ad\ncommunities \nare excluded (Clarke et al., 2019).\nHowever, activities such as agriculture, hunting \nand infrastructure construction projects continue \nto encroach on protected areas, with consequences \non their integrity. This encroachment is a conse-\nquence of the communities\u2019 poverty, as well as of \ntheir resistance to the creation of protected areas \n(Lewis,\u00a01996).\nAnother type of conflict is becoming increas-\ningly important on the outskirts of some protected \nareas, namely that between humans and wildlife \nthat approach villages and devastate crops (UICN, \n2015a). This issue is discussed in detail in Chapter\u202f5. \nThe territories around protected areas also are \naffected by conflicts related to access to land. The \ninadequate management of land issues is mainly due \nto a lack of knowledge on the part of land-use plan-\nners of the complexity of local dynamics of natural \nresource exploitation (Binot & Joiris, 2007).\nThese conflicts are exacerbated by other factors, \nsuch as the prevailing insecurity in the subregion and \nin neighboring countries, and the abusive behavior \nof some eco-guards toward local and indigenous \ncommunities. Cases of physical abuse, torture, confis-\ncation of fresh meat, extrajudicial executions and \ndestruction of property have been reported by human \nrights organizations.\n\nDocument 441: 187\nwhere positive benefits of wildlife exist, inter\u00ad\nactions \nwith wildlife are framed negatively. Complaints \nexpressed by local farmers can make human-elephant \nconflict a highly political issue between protected area \nmanagers and local communities. This is intensified \ndue to a widespread lack of understanding about the \nrole of each conservation actor.\nUnderstanding perceptions of wildlife and the \nprevalent conservation conflict matters and needs to \ninform wildlife tolerance and co-existence strategies \nand the implementation of management responses \n(Nsonsi et al., 2017, 2018; Vasudev et al., 2020). When \naddressing human-wildlife conflict, it is therefore \nimportant to understand who the different stake-\nholders are, what their interests are, and what types of \nconflict exist between them.\n3.2.2 Lack of participation and ownership \nof wildlife and protected areas\nPerceptions might also reflect underlying issues of \nwildlife ownership, differences in benefit sharing and \nstakeholder involvement as well as power differentials \nbetween different human groups (institutional vulnera-\nbility). Overall, protected area management in Central \nAfrica reflects a top-down conservation strategy in \nwhich locals are mostly excluded from decision making. \nHowever, authorities in charge of managing protected \nareas in Central Africa have limited technical skills \nand financial means. International Non Governmental \nOrganizations (NGOs, including foreign staff) there-\nfore often take over much of the daily work on the \nground in collaboration with the government. Given \nthis strong presence of NGOs, locals consider them as \nthe owners of wildlife and the management body of \nprotected areas. This is further exacerbated by so-called \nPublic-Private Partnerships (PPP) in which NGOs \ntake over the management body of a protected area \n(Hatchwell, 2014). \nConflicts between local people and protected area \nmanagers are common around national parks. This is \ndue to a lack of local community participation in the \nmanagement of protected areas, and occasionally poor \nrelationships between local people and protected area \nmanagers (Lambini et al., 2019). Correspondingly, \nlocal people often have hostile attitudes towards \nwildlife authorities and the concept of protected areas \n(West et al., 2006).\n\nDocument 108: To our knowledge, half a dozen \nPPPs and PMCs have been concluded with ICCN \nsince 2005 in DRC.\nIn conclusion, it should be emphasized that any \nconservation financing strategy must involve a range \nof mechanisms that complement each other. These \ndifferent funding instruments need to be mobilized at \nvarious scales, from local (a site) to national, or even \nsubregional (Gobin & Landreau, 2017). \n6. Local and indigenous \ncommunities and protected \nareas in Central Africa: reducing \nconflicts, enhancing opportunities\nThe reconciliation of environmental and socio-eco-\nnomic issues within the framework of national and local \ndevelopment plans is a major challenge for the creation \nand management of protected areas. The current \napproach is based on a new paradigm: \u201cConservation \nas a lever for development, security and resilience\u201d. \nThis means no longer considering protected areas only \nwithin the strict limits of their perimeters, but rather \nconsidering the entire matrix of the landscapes that \nsurround them and all of the social, economic and \nenvironmental issues that are at stake. \nOne of the factors hindering the achievement of \nthe objectives assigned to protected areas is in effect \nthe state of conflict that has long prevailed and still \nprevails between managers and local and indigenous \ncommunities.

These databases \nshould be suitably organized to enable further data \nprocessing, support analyses and facilitate the adop-\ntion of result-oriented approaches. These same data \nshould be able to be updated regularly. \nOne of the main challenges is archiving data \ncollected in the field (for example, during research \ncampaigns, \nanti-poaching \npatrols, \nterritory \ninspections, ecological monitoring and monitor-\ning-evaluation exercises). Data collected using \ndigital tools (for example, smartphones, iPads, \nCybertracker, IMET Offline, laptop computers and \ntablets) must be transferred to the central system \nof the protected area, either remotely if the data \n\u00ad\ncollection tools are able to do so, otherwise as soon\n\nDocument 333: Decision-makers must be informed about \nthe situation in the field, the implementation status of \nstrategies (or management plans) and, more gener-\nally, the state of biodiversity conservation in their \n\u00ad\nreference site, country or region.\nWith respect to this objective, it is important to be \nable to have a structured information system that can \noffer a transparent view of the vital information actu-\nally available on different themes and on protected \narea management issues.\nAt the national level, the overall framework for \nintervention is usually the CBD and the national \nbiodiversity conservation strategy. It is essential to \nfacilitate the monitoring of their implementation \nthrough \u00ad\nefficiency and performance indicators. \nVital information is the information that is \ncrucial or truly important for decision-making. \nIt is the information that enables decision-\nmakers to avoid drowning in a sea of excess \ninformation, only a small portion of which is \nrelevant or directly useful for decision-making. \nAn efficient information system should enable \ndecision-makers to access a dashboard and \ninstruments that allow them to easily assess \nand make decisions about a situation.\nFor each priority management objective iden-\ntified (for example, the conservation of animal or \nplant species, of habitats, of ecosystem services, etc.), \nmonitoring specific indicators and related reference \nlevels will allow decision-makers to visualize the gap \nbetween the actual situation and the target situation. \nWhen these indicators are unavailable, specific work \nshould be initiated with the supervisory authorities \nto formulate them (or reformulate them if neces-\nsary).

The constitution of such an information \nsystem would make it possible to establish indis-\npensable links between the planning, monitoring \nand evaluation of actions, ensuring an approach and \nresponses consistent with the reality on the ground.\u00a0\nAnother important issue involves the practical \ndifficulties encountered when the status of specific situ-\nations (particular themes, assets, or threats) needs to be \nrepresented by compiling different types of informa-\ntion coming from different sources, origins and periods, \nTable\u202f2 \u2013 Main constraints related to implementing sustainable data collection systems\nMain constraints\nAssociated issues\nInsufficient financial \nand logistical \nresources\nThe establishment of long-term systems for collecting \nand\u00a0processing data requires substantial financial resources.\nWeak staff capacities \nin the field and in \ncentral services\nThere have been significant technological advances \nin\u00a0collection, storage and analysis tools. Certain phenomena \nobserved in protected areas require sophisticated tools  \nto be able to quantify them. Although these tools exist, \nstaff\u00a0are not sufficiently trained in their use.\nInadequate \nstaffing levels\nThe staff available is often insufficient to guarantee \nthe proper functioning of the planning, coordination, \nmonitoring and evaluation processes, or to guarantee the \nproper implementation of field activities, an inherent part \nof\u00a0management.\nInstitutional instability \nAdministrative staff posted to sites are subject to particularly \nrapid rotations. In addition, the departure of an individual \nis\u00a0rarely anticipated and not at all prepared.\n\nDocument 336: When protected areas and national services have \nbeen able to equip themselves with digital infor-\nmation systems, the ways data are stored had to be \nadapted. Indeed, they are generally designed to facil-\nitate the storage of information for consultation and \nvisualization purposes rather than for the purpose of \nactually processing and extracting data to produce \nanalysis reports and support decision-making. \nFurthermore, there is a lack of synergy and pooling \nof efforts between the operators of national moni-\ntoring systems and those of OFAC\u2019s regional system, \nwhich limits the emergence of a comprehensive \nperspective. It is therefore useful to strengthen the \ninteroperability and articulation between databases \nand to favor systems which, thanks to a structure in \ndifferent thematic modules, support and facilitate \nprocessing and analysis processes.\nThree key criteria should guide data collection, \nand particularly the choice of data collection tools \nand instruments: quantification, comparability, and \nchange of scale. Tools and information systems \nfollowing these principles exist and are used in Central \nAfrica, including, for example, the IMET tool, whose \ndatabase offers \u201cadvanced\u201d data processing capacities \n(OFAC, 2020).\nQuantification: need to quantify data as \naccurately as possible. This element is critical \nto supply reference data and develop work \nplans that are as accurate as possible.\nComparability: possibility to compare the \nsituation and performance of different \nprotected areas regarding specific aspects.\nScaling up: the ability to perform analyses \nat the level of protected area systems \n(national, regional or ecosystem) based on \ninformation on individual protected areas.\nIt also is critical to clearly define the procedures \nand modalities for the transmission of informa-\ntion both at the local level and to higher levels (e.g., \nnational agency or service responsible for protected \nareas, OFAC). The definition of the data transmission \nsystem and the roles of each within it, and rigorous \nadherence to these procedures and modalities, form \nthe basis of effective information management.\n4.3 Responses to the main challenges \nrelated to information management\nThe main challenges related to the continuous \nupdating of information on protected areas are, \nbeyond essential financial resources, the total absence \nof standards for data transmission systems and for \nclear workflow within protected areas and between \nthese areas and the administrations concerned.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"Let's discuss the context of data collection in the management of protected areas."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":334,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

These dynamics are behind the increase in conflicts between pastoralists and farmers, between pastoralists themselves, and more generally between people and wildlife.","reference_context":"Document 566: They keep the \nanimals near their camps or on the outskirts of the \nurban centers where they live and work. \nThe owners in questions do not practice transhu-\nmance, but their animals join those of trans\u00ad\nhumant \npastoralists and other agropastoralists on the \npasturelands during the dry season. Once their \nherds have reached a certain size, some owners, who \nmay be businessmen or government bureaucrats, \nhire young herders to escort their animals to more \nremote pasturelands. When traveling, these young \nherders do not always respect the boundaries of \ntranshumance corridors or the management rules \ngoverned by and negotiated with local institutions \nand state authorities. These situations are often at \nthe root of major local conflicts when the animals \ndestroy farmers\u2019 fields. \nOther young pastoralists are not thriving and are \nlimiting themselves to small holdings. They suffer \nfrom a lack of alliances needed to access strategic \nareas. They are then sometimes obliged to engage in \nactivities such as cutting down trees to produce and \nsell wood charcoal, etc. Some become poachers or \nturn to activities involving the illegal collection and \nuse of natural resources. These young people from \npastoral communities also have a tendency to join \ngangs and rebel groups. They help to maintain the \nclimate of insecurity that is now beginning to charac-\nterize the outskirts of the most remote protected areas \nwhere bandits and rebel groups take refuge. This was \nnotably the case of Faro National Park in Cameroon \nseveral years ago. The involvement of young pastora\u00ad\nlists in this phenomenon testifies to a complex crisis \nin pastoral societies, one fueled by intergenerational \ntensions, a lack of interest on the part of governments \nin these mobile populations, increasing impoverish-\nment and growing insecurity in pastoral regions.\n\nDocument 563: 230\nlife habitats. On the other hand, the overall herd size \nof wealthy pastoralists developing \u201centreprenurial\u201d \npastoralism is increasing exponentially, involving new \npractices that do not include the historical, cultural, \nsocial and societal features of pastoralism, and which \nare considered to be the main causes of local conflicts \nand the destruction of wildlife habitats. \n1.3.4 Pastoral areas on the fringes of \nagricultural development\nDespite considerable social, economic and polit-\nical progress, transhumant pastoralists generally are \nsubject to a certain degree of cultural and spatial \nisolation. In pastoralist regions, human development \nindicators remain poor, and the provision of public \nservices is limited. Basic services are largely inac-\ncessible for transhumant pastoralists. The remote \nconditions of pastoralist regions often justify a \nlow-level of government investment. Furthermore, \ndecision makers promoting territorial development \nprograms have long overlooked transhumant commu-\nnities. Mobility is often perceived to be an obstacle to \nthe organization of space. Pastoral systems continue \nto be described as \u201ctraditional\u201d. The \u201cmulti-scale\u201d \n\u00ad\ncharacter of transhumant livestock systems (disper-\nsion of production spaces and marketing spaces) \nconfers on them a reputation of being systems that \nare difficult to control (Harchies et al., 2007). As a \nresult, public territorial development initiatives rarely \nconsider the dynamics of transhumant pastoralists\u2019 \nuse of space (Binot et al., 2006).\nA question to consider is whether the agricultural \npolicies for agro-industry development implemented \nbetween 1990 and 2000 also had a significant impact \non transhumant pastoral systems. Pastoral land used \non a seasonal basis was considerably reduced in favor \nof other, more intensive agricultural uses (dry season \nsorghum, locally known as berbere, and cotton). \nAgricultural intensification programs, increased areas \nunder cultivation and improvements in agricultural \ntechniques (for example, irrigation, extension of \ncotton crops) have sometimes directly influenced the \nrise in conflicts between farmers and pastoralists.\n\nDocument 573: Pastoralists practicing medium-distance transhumance stay for the duration of the dry \nseason. Their herds make the most of the end of the berb\u00e9r\u00e9 harvest. Some pastoralist families \nestablish themselves more permanently and engage in small-scale farming. Sedentary farmers \nalso are investing in livestock to diversify their income. There has been a significant growth \nin cattle livestock, and agro-sylvi-pastoral farming systems are increasing in number. There is \nheavy pressure around the transhumance corridors when thousands of heads of cattle throng \ntogether in the peripheral area. Animal movements are becoming more complicated. The tran-\nshumance corridors are reduced and sometimes completely obstructed by crops while access \nto important areas of mixed uses is very difficult due to the extension of farming activities.\nThe advance of the agriculture front on the savannas and the pastoralism area constituted by \ntranshumance corridors, and the growth in livestock numbers stemming from transhumant \npastoralists settling in more permanently and from investments in livestock by farming inhab-\nitants, are the main causes of the degradation of wildlife resources. These dynamics are behind \nthe increase in conflicts between pastoralists and farmers, between pastoralists themselves, \nand more generally between people and wildlife (destruction of crops by pests and attacks on \nlivestock by wild animals, slaughter of animals for trade). \nNumerous studies have been conducted in Zakouma National Park to better understand \nthe dynamics at play, the diversity of stakeholders, their respective strategies, and the short \nand medium-term issues (political, food, economic, energy, sociocultural) involving natural \nresources. This has led to the development of a landscape approach to address questions \nregarding conservation, farming and livestock. This involves shifting to an approach seeking \nto integrate the park and its vital ranges for large wildlife into the development of surrounding \nterritories through the application of an inclusive land-use plan. In particular, the establish-\nment of the Greater Zakouma Functional Ecosystem should enable conservation efforts to be \nexpanded by integrating the role of local communities.\n235\nGreater Zakouma (Chad): strong expansion of the agriculture sector\n\nDocument 575: poachers frequently use the paths and tracks followed by transhumant herds. By doing so, \nthey can consistently avoid densely populated areas and centres. To cope with the threat of \ninsecurity, transhumant pastoralists are sometimes pushed to arm themselves. This state of \naffairs leads local populations to identify the pastoralists with the rebels and large poachers.\nIn CAR, the transhumant pastoralists arrive each year from the northeast and settle down \nin the Chinko area from December to May. These pastoralists are armed to protect their \nanimals from rebel groups circulating along their route. Most are shepherds employed by \nrich elites living in Darfur. While the cohabitation with the Chinko reserve may appear to \nbe more peaceful than in DRC, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the pastoralists from \nlarge poachers and rebel groups. This confusion can again accentuate the climate of fear and \n\u00ad\ninsecurity among local communities.\nThe passage of herds near the protected areas raises several problems for the managers of \nthese spaces. The herds threaten natural wildlife habitats and the pastoralists sometimes hunt \nintensively when passing through.\nUnder the effect of climate change and growing insecurity in DRC and CAR, the move-\nments of transhumant pastoralists are going to intensify in these isolated regions where the \ngovernments exercise little territorial control. Existing laws have been poorly adapted to the \nsituation for a very long time. They appear totally inadequate for regulating the passage of \nherds on both sides of the borders. The transhumant pastoralists are both victims and perpe-\ntrators of insecurity. Investments to secure the transhumance routes, notably the water points \nand improved market access, appear today as the best solution. The objective is to reduce \nconflicts between communities and establish a sustainable use of resources in keeping with \nconservation goals.\n237\n2.2 Integrating transhumant \npastoralism into the management \nof\u00a0protected area peripheries\n2.2.1.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"Let's consider the growth in livestock numbers and the advance of the agriculture front on the savannas and the pastoralism area."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":566,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

This situation \ncreated misunderstanding and tension on both sides.\nIt is therefore recommended that the State refrain \nfrom interfering in the day-to-day operational \nmanagement of the protected area as long as the part-\nnership agreement fully delegates this to the private \npartner. On the other hand, during meetings of the \ngovernance entity of the protected area (for example, \nthe Board of Directors), the State is fully entitled \nto discuss with the private partner the operational \nmanagement modalities and request that certain \nconcerns be taken into account. However, once deci-\nsions are taken, the State must let the private partner \nassume full responsibility for their implementation.\nEven after fifteen years of existence, PPPs are \nstill a fairly new model in Central Africa and remain \nuncommon in many countries (Figure\u202f1). The \nlearning stage has thus not yet been completed, either \nby the private partners or the State. The experiences \nunderway are rich in lessons for building a balanced \ncontractual relationship between the two partners \nwith a view to delivering sustainable results in terms \nof protecting biodiversity.\n4. What type of public-private \npartnerships for Central Africa?\n4.1 Sub-regional guide on best-\npractices for the management \nof\u00a0protected areas through PPPs\nFor several years, national institutions in charge \nof managing protected areas have asked sub-\u00ad\nregional \norganizations (RAPAC, COMIFAC) for their \nsupport to better understand and adopt PPPs. The \npositive results achieved in the initial experiments, \nand the difficulties and weaknesses identified in \nthe first evaluations undertaken, have continued to \n\u00ad\nstimulate growing interest in the mechanism.\n\nDocument 287: 122\n122\n5. Conclusions \nand recommendations\n5.1 Conclusions\nSince the establishment of the contracts for \nGaramba and Virunga National Parks in 2005, \npublic-private partnerships have become an impor-\ntant tool for the management of protected areas in \nCentral Africa. The six contracts that reached the \nend of their terms were all extended, unlike in other \nAfrican countries, notably Ethiopia.\nAfrican Parks Network dominated the PPP land-\nscape in Central Africa in the early years and remains \nan important actor, holding six of the 13 PPP contracts \nwhich are active in the sub-region. WWF and WCS, \nwhich also have been very present in this region for \ndecades through the provision of technical assistance, \nhave recently converted their historic collaboration in \ncertain protected areas into PPPs, which testifies to \nthe interest in this model. Furthermore, new actors \nare gradually emerging, such as Forgotten Parks (in \nDRC) and more recently No\u00e9 (in negotiations for two \nPPPs in Chad and Congo).\nSince the first partnership contracts were signed in \n2005, major changes have resulted in a second gener-\nation of contracts. This evolution notably includes \ngreater ownership by governments, which have \nformulated increasingly detailed expectations. The \nexample of the Garamba contract is instructive. In \n2005, it only contained seven pages without specific \nexpectations; in 2016, the contract had extended to 24 \npages and included specific targets.\nTo strengthen the appropriation of PPPs by \ngovernments, COMIFAC has developed a guide \nto best-practices for the management of protected \nareas through PPPs (available in French, Guide Sous-\u00ad\nR\u00e9gional de Bonnes Pratiques pour la Gestion des Aires \nProt\u00e9g\u00e9es en Mode Partenariat Public-Priv\u00e9 PPP en \nAfrique Centrale). The guide focuses on the prepara-\ntion of tender documents to draw the attention of \ndecision-makers to the gaps and weaknesses to be \navoided in each of the four phases of the development \nprocess of a PPP project.\nThe diversification of PPPs in Central Africa, \nmoving beyond the \u201ctotal\u201d delegated management \nmodel, remains tentative.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm interested in the public-private partnership contracts that were first signed in 2005."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":257,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

Wilderness Safaris is a leading \nAfrican safari tour operator with over 38 years of experience, operating in ten coun-\ntries and with over 40 camps. The company has provided Congo with a wealth of \nexperience in the construction and operation of camps in southern and eastern Africa. \nWith government support, the partners embarked on a three-site construction project \nin and around Odzala-Kokoua National Park. This was the first project of its kind in \nCentral Africa. \nAt the start of this project, local expertise was limited and the technical skills required \nwere unavailable in the country. The southern and eastern African experts mobilized \ndid not have experience in the context of Francophone Africa. Technically, they were \nsuccessful in building the infrastructure, but logistically and financially, many mistakes \nwere made due to a lack of knowledge of local and national regulations and laws, \nincluding errors due to language barriers.

In reality, \nshared governance was developed in the PPP frame-\nwork with international actors, but has been slow \nto take shape with rural communities. Despite the \ncommitments made by governments, many protected \nareas are still under government governance (85%),or \nhave government representatives on their governance \nbody (almost 100%).

The process \nrelated to the creation of protected areas has not taken this reality into account, \nthus carrying within itself the seeds of separation between humans and nature \n(Monpetit, 2013). Consequently, rural communities often have been excluded from \nthe decision-making processes and the management of protected areas as well as \nthe\u00a0resources they relied on to survive.

Conclusion\nIn Central Africa, we have seen that the govern-\nance systems of protected areas are complex, based \non complex interactions between institutional \nstructures and actors with divergent and overlap-\nping interests and norms. Over the past thirty years, \nthese systems have evolved significantly, although \nin different ways. Public governance is now leaning \nmore towards governance by an independent agency \nrather than a ministerial department. Shared govern-\nance has developed but mainly in the framework \nof public-private partnerships with international \norganizations. The sharing of responsibilities with \nlocal communities is being tested in various sites \nbut is still in its infancy. Finally, one protected area \nwith private governance and two with community \ngovernance were identified.\nThus, the governance of protected areas in the \nsubregion is undergoing profound change. Central \nAfrica is now at a crossroads in finding the right \ngovernance model reflecting the realities of  the variety \nof human and ecological contexts. Although there is \nstill a long way to go, in some cases it is increasing \nwelfare and social equity for people and significantly \nreducing threats and pressures on protected areas. \nWhat appears to be a fundamental condition \ntoday is the pursuit of reforms within governance \nsystems so that they match local contexts.

All of \nthis is a first step towards officially shared govern-\nance, or even governance that could eventually be \ndelegated to rural communities.\nThe assessment made here corresponds mainly \nto terrestrial protected areas, which were the first \nhistorical models established. Marine protected areas, \nwhich are more recent, also have appeared in Central \nAfrica since the end of the 1990s. While the govern-\nance of terrestrial protected areas is evolving towards \nmore inclusive models, marine protected areas are all \nunder public governance, thus limiting the possible \nparticipation of users of the maritime space.\n4.2.

Thus, in the case of \nelephants, it is not only crucial that we fully under-\nstand the ecology of forest elephant behavior to \nmodify their behavior (Mumby & Plotnik, 2018), \nwe also need to acquire a clear understanding of the \nhuman dimension of the conflict (Dickman, 2010; \nBennett et al., 2017a; Hill, 2017; Wallace & Hill, \n2017; Gross, 2019; Shaffer et al., 2019).\nUnfortunately, human-wildlife approaches are \nrarely systematically included in conservation and \nprotected area management projects in Central Africa\n\nDocument 415: In this context, it is \nimportant to note that activities addressing various \nhuman-wildlife conflicts might involve completely \ndifferent mitigation techniques (e.g., guarding and \nfencing related to livestock). \nSince forest elephants are often mentioned as the \nnumber one conflict species in Central Africa, we \nbelieve that it is crucial to address this conflict, wherever \nit occurs. Measures to protect elephants increasingly \nhave been applied in recent years to combat wildlife \ncrime. While the impact of people on forest elephants \n(poaching, retaliatory killing, etc.) has dramatic impacts \non elephant populations and the ecosystem (Breuer \net al., 2016; Poulsen et al., 2018; Berzaghi et al., 2019), \nwe do not cover this wildlife crime aspect as it concerns \na completely different set of law enforcement actors \nand activities. Instead, we address the implications of \nelephant conservation for people living with forest \nelephants and discuss how addressing human-\u00ad\nelephant \nconflict should lead to co-existence of humans and \nelephants in Central Africa. \nWhile our current knowledge of human-\u00ad\nelephant \nconflict and its mitigation in Central Africa remains \nastonishingly limited (Naughton et al., 1999; \u00ad\nNguinguiri \net al., 2017), many lessons can be learned from studies \nconducted on elephants in isolated protected areas with \nhard edges in West Africa (Barnes, 1999; Boafo et al., \n2004; Barnes et al., 2005, 2015; Gunn et al., 2014), \nas well as from general guidelines related to human-\u00ad\nelephant conflict in Southern and East Africa as well \nas Asia (Hoare, 2000a, 2012, 2015; Nelson et al., \n2003; Dublin & Hoare, 2004; Lee & Graham, 2006; \nParker et al., 2007; Osei-Owusu, 2018; Gross, 2019; \nShaffer et al., 2019). \nThe conflict situation and potential mitigation \nmeasures differ according to the intactness of the land-\nscape, which can be put into three broad categories: \n1.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I am looking for strategies to increase tolerance for co-existence with wildlife, specifically forest elephants, in Central Africa."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":488,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}

These \nforests, in particular the vast expanses of peatlands in \nthe Congo Basin, store 30.6 Gt of carbon in their soil, \nor the equivalent of the above-ground carbon stock of \nthe entire Congo Basin (Dargie et al.,\u00a02017; Ifo et al., \n2018). Unfortunately, they remain today very poorly \nprotected (Dargie et al., 2019).\n\nDocument 872: 357\n357\nIn Central Africa, the above-ground carbon stock \nof ecosystems with tree cover greater than or equal to \n10% is estimated to be about 31.8\u2009Gt (Saatchi et al., \n2011). This carbon stock is very unevenly distributed \nbetween countries; due to its size and forest cover, \nDRC is in the lead, with nearly 60% of the subre-\ngion\u2019s above-ground carbon (Figure\u202f2). The forested \ncountries of Cameroon, Congo and Gabon also stock \nabout 10%, and the Central African Republic (CAR) \njust slightly less.  Rwanda and Burundi, on the other \nhand, are highly deforested but show good potential \nfor land rehabilitation. This also is the case for Chad, a \nvast Sahelian country which does not stand out in the \nfigure due to the difficulty of taking into account trees \noutside forests, but which has strong \u00ad\nopportunities \nfor\u00a0afforestation.  \nFigure\u202f2 \u2013 Above-ground carbon stocks by country in Central Africa\nI Burundi  I Cameroon  I Congo  I Gabon  I EG  I CAR  I DRC  I Rwanda  I STP  I Chad\nTotal = 31.8 Gt C\nEG: Equatorial Guinea; CAR: Central African Republic; DRC: Democratic Republic of the Congo; STP: Sao Tome and Principe. \nNote 1: above-ground carbon stocks of ecosystems with tree cover \u2265 10%.

They \nallow rainfall levels to be maintained up to several \nthousand kilometers inland; in contrast, rainfall \ndecreases exponentially in deforested areas with \ndistance from the sea (Makarieva et al., 2009).\n\nDocument 875: 358\n358\nimpacts, but\u00a0they are equally capable of helping to \nfight climate change, beyond their primary role of \nprotecting ecosystems. \nOFAC (Observatoire des For\u00eats d\u2019Afrique Centrale) \nis currently assessing the carbon stocks conserved \nthrough the Central African protected area network. \nThese protected areas extend over different biomes \nand contain a wide range of ecosystems. Some of \nthese ecosystems, such as dense humid tropical and \nsubtropical forests, store a significant amount of \nthe world\u2019s carbon. An initial, very broad estimate \nindicates a total carbon stock of 14.9\u2009Gt\u2009C for the \nensemble of Central African protected areas, poten-\ntially representing three years of fossil fuel emissions \nof the United States. Above-ground carbon consti-\ntutes slightly less than 45% of this total (Figure\u202f3a).\nProtected areas cover approximately 17.6% of \nthe land area of COMIFAC (Commission des For\u00eats \n\u00ad\nd\u2019Afrique Centrale) member countries (OFAC, 2020), \nyet they contain an estimated 20-25% of these coun-\ntries\u2019 carbon stocks (Figure\u202f3b).

Protected areas \nin the subregion are home to unique biodiversity, one \nwhich remains rich, and highly diversified ecosystems \n(Doumenge et al., 2015). \nThe dense humid forests of Central Africa \ncontain the highest amount of biomass per unit area \n(418.3\u202f\u00b1\u200991.8\u2009\nT\/ha) of all tropical forests, and thus \nstore significant amounts of carbon (Saatchi et al., \n2011; Slik et al., 2013). They contribute substan-\ntially to climate equilibrium at local, regional and \ncontinental levels. Diverse models of the impacts \nof deforestation in the Congo Basin on the climate \nindicate a likely increase in ground temperatures and \nreduction in rainfall in many areas of Central Africa, \nand severe deforestation could potentially impact the \nclimate of neighboring regions (Nogherotto et al., \n2013; Akkermans et al., 2014; Bell et al., 2015). \nUnfortunately, these high Central African \ndeforestation scenarios may not be as far off as \nthey seem. Deforestation rates in West and Central \nAfrica continue to increase, edging up to 0.59% per \nyear, and sometimes even higher. DRC, for example, \nhas one of the highest deforestation rates in the \nworld (0.83% per year), ranking just behind Brazil \nand ahead of Indonesia in terms of net forest loss for \nthe period 2010-2020 (all forests included, dry and \nhumid; FAO, 2020).\nProtected areas in Central Africa also are \ncontending with considerable anthropogenic pres-\nsures that are now being exacerbated by the effects of \nclimate change. They face multiple threats, including \ndeforestation, the clearing of land for agriculture, the \ndevelopment of mining projects, and poaching. These \nare weakening the protected area network, leaving it \nmore sensitive to climate change impacts.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"Considering the intertropical above-ground carbon, let's focus on Central Africa."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":871,"topic":"Protected Area Conservation"}}
