{"text":"10\nINTRODUCTION\nThe second edition of the State of Protected Areas in Central Africa 2020 takes a close look \nat the protected areas of COMIFAC member countries. COMIFAC is one of the world\u2019s largest \nnetworks working to protect biodiversity and combat climate change. This book helps to \nsound the alarm about the risks and dangers facing the planet, but also covers numerous initi-\natives essential for the well-being of people within their environment.\nCentral Africa is a land of diversity, one marked by diverse climates, soils, landscapes, ecosys-\ntems, fauna and flora. The home of the Congo Basin, Central Africa also is a land of extremes. \nNot only is the Congo Basin the second largest continuous tropical forest track in the world, it \nalso is the site of the world\u2019s largest complex of swamp forests and peat bogs. But this land, \none which has nurtured generations of Africans, is facing mounting pressures.\nWorldwide, 2019 was the second hottest year on record, just 0.04 \u00b0C cooler than 2016. More-\nover, the decade 2010-2019 was the warmest ever recorded. Central Africa for the most part \nescaped the massive fires that ravaged the Amazon, Southeast Asia and Australia in 2019-\n2020, but this may not be the case in the future. The subregion has not been spared from \nglobal warming. Savannas and dry forests already have been weakened and attacked by fires, \nand pasturelands are no longer green, leaving animals hungry. Livestock farmers are forced to \nventure into protected areas for water and fresh grass for their herds. \nEcosystems in the countries of Central Africa are becoming increasingly degraded due to \nintensifying anthropogenic pressures driven in particular by population growth and demand \nfrom international markets. Natural ecosystems are exposed to wildlife poaching, an expansion \nof transhumant pastoralism, an increase in mining permits, industrial agriculture and family \nfarming, the exploitation of wood (timber, fuel wood), conflicts over land, and the list goes on."}

Natural ecosystems are exposed to wildlife poaching, an expansion \nof transhumant pastoralism, an increase in mining permits, industrial agriculture and family \nfarming, the exploitation of wood (timber, fuel wood), conflicts over land, and the list goes on.\nIn this constantly changing context, where international and local challenges are closely \nintertwined, protected areas are one of the most effective management tools for slowing \nbiodiversity loss, mitigating the impact of climate change, and helping ecosystems and human \ncommunities adapt to change. Some countries have already understood this and have devel-\noped land-use plans that include national protected area networks capable of playing this \ntriple ecological, social and economic role that is the backbone of sustainable development. \nState of Protected Areas in Central Africa 2020 illustrates the subregion\u2019s contribution to safe-\nguarding the quality of life of current and future generations. The book describes creative \ninitiatives and approaches to biodiversity management. It calls for the meaningful participa-\ntion of local communities and indigenous peoples in the management of protected areas. It \nsuggests solutions facilitating the peaceful coexistence of humans and large wildlife. With a \ndetermination based on lessons learned, it suggests approaches and practices for the wise use \nof natural resources. \nThis book aims to offer guidelines for discussion and action to support countries in the subre-\ngion as they embark on the road to economic development.

Corruption is encouraging illegal logging, the trafficking of wildlife by-products \nand non-timber forest products, etc. \nIt is a question, here and now, of taking a radical change in direction. The pattern of complaints, \ntensions and conflicts must be abandoned in favor of a new paradigm, one of collaboration \nand partnership between protected area managers and every stakeholder who uses, protects \nand manages biodiversity and natural resources, whether pastures or forests, farmland or \nwoodland, mines or elephants... The book in your hands aims to encourage the coordina-\ntion of sectoral activities at the territory and regional landscape level, the strengthening and \nimprovement of conservation practices and local community involvement in biodiversity \nconservation and management, as well as the training and capacity building of stakeholders \nand the \u00ad\nadoption of flexible, learning-by-doing approaches to environmental management. \nIt is up to all of us to make this a reality.

The publication of this valuable \nreport is an important step in a long process that began at the 5th IUCN World Parks Congress \nin Durban in 2003. \nDuring the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, governments and \nother stakeholders made considerable progress towards achieving several key objectives of \nAichi Target 11 relating to protected areas. \nThis State of Protected Areas report, made possible by the BIOPAMA program through funding \nfrom the European Union and the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, docu-\nments this progress and illustrates it with numerous case studies from Central Africa. It also \nshows how protected area systems are a key component in the region\u2019s conservation strategy, \nwithout which biodiversity loss would have been much greater. \nThe report makes a significant contribution to assessing the current status of the many factors \nthat contribute to the success of protected area systems. It examines the progress made in \nmeeting national and global goals, and measures this against reliable standards of effective-\nness. It also provides a diagnosis of what is missing, where the gaps are and how to address \nthem through targeted capacity building. \nAs Nelson Mandela said at the IUCN World Parks Congress in Durban, \u201cWe know that the key \nto a sustainable future for protected areas lies in developing partnerships. It is only through \nalliances and partnerships that protected areas can be adapted to the needs of society.\u201d Under-\nstanding and documenting the relevance of protected areas to the needs of societies is one of \nthe main contributions of this report. \nWith increasing population pressure and associated natural resources consumption, there are \nfew places in the world where investment in effective governance and management is not \nrequired to address threats and maintain ecosystem integrity. By establishing a valuable base-\nline against which future progress can be measured, such a report contributes to regional \nand global baseline information systems, as well as to partnerships that will support better \ninformed decision-making at national and global levels."}

{"text":"14\nPREFACE\nF. Palla, L. Itsoua-Madzous & C. Doumenge\nPlanning and managing protected areas require \nknowledge about the status of these areas and the \nissues affecting them. In 2015, the first edition of the \nState of Protected Areas in Central Africa (SOPA-\nCA) provided an up-to-date assessment of national \nand subregional networks. This summary report \nwas prepared by the Central African Forest Obser-\nvatory (OFAC), under the auspices of the Central \nAfrican Forests Commission (COMIFAC). The \npreparation of SOPA 2015 was funded by the Euro-\npean Union through the RIOFAC project and the \n\u00ad\nBIOPAMA-IUCN program, the Network of Central \nAfrican Protected Areas (RAPAC) through the \nOBAPAC project (Observatory of Biodiversity and \nProtected Areas of Central Africa), and the German \nAgency for International Cooperation through the \nGIZ COMIFAC support project.\u00a0 Produced by a \nmultinational group of Central African protected \narea experts, SOPA 2015 focused on presenting each \ncountry\u2019s protected area network, both with regard to \nthe types of protected areas as well as their size and \ndistribution. This was complemented by summary \nanalyses of various themes (legislation, institutions, \ngovernance, support projects, socio-economic issues). \nFollowing the success of SOPA 2015, many \ninstitutions voiced a desire to improve and rapidly \nupdate this publication. The momentum created by \nthe production of the first edition led to the devel-\nopment of the second, which explores in more detail \nvarious themes related to biodiversity conservation \nand protected area governance and management. \nSOPA 2020, the volume you are now holding in your \nhands, completes and updates the inventory of the \nsubregion\u2019s protected area networks, but also breaks \nnew ground by delving deeply into certain themes \nthat were either only briefly discussed (governance, \ntourism, etc.) or not mentioned at all (human-\u00ad\nelephant conflicts, mining and oil industry, etc.) in \nthe first volume."}

These themes were discussed and \napproved in 2018 during a meeting of protected area \nspecialists held in Douala.\nThe objective of SOPA 2020 is to contribute \nto a more effective use of approaches and tools for \ncollecting and analysing data on protected area \nmanagement in Central Africa. It aims to provide an \noverview of their importance with regard to global \nchanges, but also to situate protected areas within \nnational and regional territories. In keeping with the \nperspective of sustainable development in Central \nAfrica, this geographical placement also must include \nthe communities living in these territories. It is this \nmuch needed dual integration of protected areas that \nhas guided the authors throughout the book.\nThis document is intended to be used by admin-\nistrations in charge of protected areas, policy makers, \ntechnical and financial partners, research institutions, \nCivil Society Organizations (CSOs) and anyone else \ninterested in biodiversity conservation in Central \nAfrica. Special emphasis is placed on up-to-date \nand harmonized data and analysis to inform policy \nmakers and managers. It does not claim to be exhaus-\ntive, and could not cover all relevant topics related to \nprotected areas. Its objectives are to help build collec-\ntive intelligence on the subject of protected areas \nand to stimulate new analyses and syntheses rele-\nvant to and sought by conservation and sustainable \n\u00ad\ndevelopment actors."}

The social and cultural functions performed by these ecosystems are so \nessential that their alteration, let alone disappearance, would have consequences \nfor the quality of life of populations at local, national and global levels.\nAs is the case in the rest of the world, biodiversity \nin the subregion is threatened, particularly through \npoaching (better organized and equipped), defor-\nestation and the expansion of shifting agriculture, \nand so-called \u201cdevelopment\u201d activities (mining, urban \nexpansion, etc.; Abernethy et al., 2016).\u00a0This impact of \nanthropogenic activities on nature is unprecedented; \nthe total mass of man-made materials (concrete, steel, \nasphalt, etc.) is increasing everywhere, and surpassed \nthat of global biomass (total mass of all living organ-\nisms) in 2020. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has \nnot reached its peak, since projects predict that this \nanthropogenic mass will at the least double by 2040 \n(Elhacham et al., 2020).\nNevertheless, biodiversity conservation and \nsustainable \nenvironmental \nmanagement \ncould \nincrease resilience and reduce the vulnerability of \nhuman societies to climate change (de Wasseige \net al., 2015; Seddon et al., 2019; see Chapter\u202f9 of this \nbook). In Africa, this change will be characterized by \nincreasingly frequent droughts and increased vari-\nability in rainfall patterns (de Wasseige et al., 2015; \nIPBES, 2019)."}

{"text":"22\nThe Aichi Targets in relation to Central African protected areas\nThe Aichi Targets, or \u201cStrategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020\u201d, were adopted in October \n2010 by the signatories of the CBD. The eleventh target aims to establish, by 2020, networks \nof protected areas or other conservation measures at the scale of territories covering at least \n17% of terrestrial and 10% of marine and coastal areas. This target concerns both increasing \nthe number of protected areas and improving their effectiveness in protecting biodiversity \n(CDB, 2011).\nDepending on the conservation areas considered, the Aichi Target for terrestrial protected \nareas is either met by a small number of countries (Equatorial Guinea, CAR and Sao Tome \nand Principe) or by the majority of them (Figure\u202f4). In fact, if only protected areas classi-\nfied by the countries according to national laws and recognized by the World Database on \nProtected Areas (WDPA) are considered, only the three countries mentioned meet the Aichi \ncriteria. On the other hand, if internationally recognized sites (World Heritage sites, Ramsar \nsites, biosphere reserves) as well as other types of protected areas recognized by States are \nconsidered, Burundi and Rwanda alone remain well below the 17% target. \nMoreover, some countries have already surpassed the target under negotiation of 30% of \nthe territory under protected area status (Congo, CAR, Sao Tome and Principe). Cameroon, \nGabon and Equatorial Guinea are not far away, making Central Africa an exemplary region for \nterrestrial biodiversity conservation \u2013 at least on paper. It will be difficult for two countries, \nBurundi and Rwanda, which have some of the highest rural population densities on the African \n\u00ad\ncontinent, to meet these targets. \nTo measure progress in meeting these international objectives, prior work consequently is \nrequired to define what is considered a \u201cprotected area\u201d with concrete and verifiable criteria. \nThis will allow the same parameters to be used and will curtail possible political considerations"}
{"text":"23\nIn Central Africa, the three most common \ncategories of protected areas are national parks \n(category\u202fII), species conservation areas (cate-\ngory\u202fIV, wildlife reserves or similar), and protected \nareas where sustainable use of biodiversity is \nallowed (category\u202fVI, various types of hunting areas; \nTable\u202f1). While national parks in savanna ecosys-\ntems often are relatively old, most forest parks are \nrecent (Doumenge et al., 2015b). This is the case, for \nexample, of the 13\u202fnational parks in Gabon, created \nin 2002, and of most forest parks in Cameroon.\nCategories IV and VI include protected areas \nthat are often vast, especially in savanna zones, to \nprotect sufficient populations of large wildlife.

The success of certain ZICs is due to the efforts private hunting company staff, \nwho at least partially monitor these territories (Scholte & Iyah, 2016). The management of \nthese hunting areas is subject to specifications; a quota of animals that can be hunted is \nset each year by the Minister of Forestry and Wildlife. In addition, wildlife assessments are \nconducted in them every five years (Booth and Chardonnet, 2015; Roulet, 2007).\nOne of the difficulties in classifying hunting areas as protected areas is the diversity of \ntheir status, governance and management (see also Table\u202f5, Chapter\u202f2).

However, the marine \necosystems which are currently protected do not repre-\nsent their diversity; Gabon having the only marine \nprotected area on the high seas (UICN, 2015b). \nThe development of a network of marine protected \nareas, designed on coherent geographical scales from \nthe point of view of ecosystems, and benefiting from \nsufficient human and material financial resources for \ntheir proper functioning, is therefore an important \nlever for the conservation of the marine and coastal \nwealth of Central Africa. The Blue Gabon program \naims to strengthen the protection of the marine \nenvironment with the establishment of 20 marine \nprotected areas, representing 26% of the national \nterritorial waters (National Geographic, 2017). This \ninitiative should encourage other coastal countries \nin the subregion to contribute more effectively to \nthe protection of marine environments and species, \nwithin the framework of the strategic work program \non marine protected areas (UICN, n.d.).\n2.3. Protected areas  \nand ecological networks\nEffective protection of biodiversity requires \nrespect for the biology and needs of its constituent \nspecies. Certain species, such as savanna (L. africana) \nand forest elephants, require vast territories to survive. \nThe main task is to allow the natural movements of \npopulations (migrations, access to food sources...) but \nalso genetic mixing, which is essential for the main-\ntenance and adaptation of animal and plant species \n(Triplet et al., 2020)."}

Wildlife erosion in these \nconcessions is indeed less significant than in forestry \nconcessions without management plans (Karsenty & \nGourlet-Fleury, 2016).\nEffective conservation policies therefore need to \ntake into account the multiplicity of land uses, partic-\nularly the areas inhabited by species that are subject \nto conservation or sustainable management measures, \nboth within and outside protected areas (Morgan & \nSanz, 2007). This means developing multi-\u00ad\nsectoral \nland-use plans, including, in particular, the use of \nwood, hunting, agriculture and the mining and \noil industries with conservation activities (see also \nChapter\u202f7).

This encroachment is a conse-\nquence of the communities\u2019 poverty, as well as of \ntheir resistance to the creation of protected areas \n(Lewis,\u00a01996).\nAnother type of conflict is becoming increas-\ningly important on the outskirts of some protected \nareas, namely that between humans and wildlife \nthat approach villages and devastate crops (UICN, \n2015a). This issue is discussed in detail in Chapter\u202f5. \nThe territories around protected areas also are \naffected by conflicts related to access to land.

This approach \nwas at the heart of the ECOFAC program as well as, \nmore recently, that of the PPPs signed between States \nand various partners (see Chapter\u202f3).\nBefore establishing a protected area, an obvious \nfirst step would be to gather information about the \npeople who live there and how they live, and to \nreceive their consent (see box section 4), to ensure \nthat conservation restrictions do not threaten their \ntraditional livelihood activities. However, as a study \nof 34 protected areas has shown (Pyh\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2016), \nthis is almost never done in most Central African \ncountries, or if it is, it is carried out incompletely."}
{"text":"49\nYet the conservation paradigm has evolved over \ntime, notably with the adoption of the CBD in 1992, \nin which biodiversity conservation and sustainable use \nare asserted as inseparable (Adam, 2012). Local and \nindigenous communities must be, along with other \nactors, including the State and conservation NGOs, \nat the heart of their management. Their involvement \nis motivated by the fact that over many generations \nthey have developed a body of knowledge that has \nenabled them to live and nourish themselves from \nthe forest and its biodiversity while preserving its \n\u00ad\nproductive capacities (FAO, 2016). \nEven if this is not yet sufficiently realized on \nthe ground, functional changes have been made \nin the definition of the management objectives of \nprotected areas, with a view to contributing to the \nstrengthening of the link between conservation and \nnatural resource use. The establishment of the IUCN \nprotected area categories, for example (see Figure\u202f1), \nrefers to different conceptions of the place of humans \nin environmental protection policies (H\u00e9ritier & \nLaslaz, 2008). \nThe operationalization of the community partici-\npatory approach in the creation and management of \nprotected areas translates into interventions at two \nlevels: the revision of regulatory frameworks and the \ndevelopment of initiatives that operationalize partici-\npatory approaches.

{"text":"54\nThe APDS complex and indigenous and local communities\nF. Mavinga, WWF-CAR and J. Barske, WWF-Germany\nThe APDS complex was created in 1990 to promote local development of impov-\nerished populations while ensuring wildlife conservation. Managers have paid \nparticular attention to the well-being of local communities and have developed a \nnumber of actions to benefit them. \nThese actions can be grouped under five headings:\n\t\n\u2013 strengthening indigenous culture: the international organization OrigiNations \nhas supported the creation of a group of indigenous youth who are contributing \nto the intergenerational protection and promotion of their cultural and natural \nheritage, as well as to the active defense of their rights;\n\t\n\u2013 informing about the rights and duties of citizens: a Human Rights Center was \ncreated by the local organization Maison de l\u2019enfant et de la femme Pygm\u00e9es and \nby the Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating Committee (IPACC). The Center \nworks with the local population (particularly the BaAka), providing various forms \nof support: legal assistance and support for conflict resolution, awareness-raising \nand training on human rights in general and on the rights of indigenous peoples in \nparticular, assistance in obtaining birth certificates to enable them to access govern-\nment services, the right to vote and stand for election, freedom of movement, etc. \nThe Center also informs and trains local civil and administrative authorities, as well \nas law enforcement officers, eco-guards, etc."}

WWF is also involved in health care and \neducation, as well as in the promotion of human rights and indigenous peoples, in \ncollaboration with MINFOF and local partners;\n\t\n\u2013 promote communication and awareness: a community radio station was set up in \n2011 in Bayanga (Radio Ndjoku), in collaboration with Radio France Internationale \n(RFI) to contribute to the peaceful coexistence of communities (awareness-raising \nprograms on human rights principles and environmental and social issues).\nIn addition to these actions, tourism has been the focus of a development strategy, \nallowing the local population to benefit from 40% of tourism revenues (see also \nChapter\u202f8)."}
{"text":"55\nAll of these actions promote greater involvement \nof local and indigenous communities in the manage-\nment of protected areas and the creation of a dynamic \nthat contributes to conservation activities by reducing \nconflicts. They also strengthen their skills in specific \nareas of activity and promote stable and regular \nsources of income, improving their quality of life and \nreducing pressures on protected areas.\nConclusion\nProtected area networks in Central Africa have \nbeen greatly expanded since the beginning of the \n20th century, both on land and at sea. This increase is \nin line with national and regional nature conservation \npolicies, but also a more global dynamic, reflected at \nthe international level through the Aichi Targets and, \nmore recently, the 30x30 objective (30% of protected \nareas by 2030) that will be negotiated at the next \nCBD Conference of the Parties. \nIf protected areas classified by States under national \nlaws and recognized by the WDPA alone are considered, \nonly a few countries have achieved the Aichi Target. \nHowever, if we add the protected areas with an inter-\nnational status (World Heritage, Ramsar, biosphere \nreserves), most countries have reached this objective \nand several are approaching the 30x30 objective.\nMoreover, when other national protected areas, \nones not recognized by the world database of protected \nareas (such as certain zones of hunting interest and \nforest reserves), are taken into account, Central Africa \ncan legitimately claim to be well on the way to rapidly \nachieving this 30x30 objective. However, in order to \nagree on the territories taken into account for the vali-\ndation of these objectives, international efforts must \nbe made to develop a common frame of reference to \nrecognize and categorize all those spaces that can be \nconsidered to be protected areas.\nThe maintenance of functional biodiversity on a \nglobal scale cannot ignore the role that certain areas \ndedicated to the sustainable use of wildlife and forest \nresources can play in maintaining a functional green \nand blue frameworks. The role of some ZICs and \nmanaged and certified forest concessions may indeed \nbe important in strengthening the connectivity of \nprotected area networks. \nThe inclusion of these types of land use could open \na new discussion in which Central Africa can offer \nits experience."}

This also means not only discussing a \npurely accounting objective of 30% of the territories \nunder more or less strong protection, but also empha-\nsizing the reality of management on the ground \nand the effectiveness of management of all of these \nterritories, whether they are conventional protected \nareas or other priority land uses. It is on this point of \nmanagement effectiveness that the main discussions \nof the CBD should focus.\nOn the other hand, it would seem misguided to \nconsider the effectiveness of protected area networks \noutside their context. The issues of network connec-\ntivity and the separation or overlapping of land uses \nmust be considered within the framework of multi-sec-\ntoral land use planning. In Central Africa, few countries \nhave set up a land-use planning policy worthy of the \nname; this is one of the major projects ahead."}
{"text":"56\nThe richness of the subregion does not only lie \nin its biodiversity, nor in its landscapes. It is also \nrich in human diversity which it is essential to \ntake into account. In the history of protected areas, \nthese peoples often have been excluded from deci-\nsion-making, even though their survival is often \ndependent on the use of natural resources. This \nhas been the source of numerous conflicts between \nmanagers and local communities, and may have \nexacerbated the latter\u2019s precarious situations. Today, \na new paradigm is emerging, calling for the inte-\ngration of these populations into the management \nof protected areas. Several examples have been \npresented in this chapter and others are discussed in \nthe following chapters.\nThis more inclusive approach will make it possible \nto highlight local knowledge, but also to leverage the \nknow-how of national and international partners \nthrough the PPPs being developed in the subregion. \nIt also will make it possible to rely on new paradigms \n(eco-development, eco-security, green economy), \nmaking it possible to mitigate the pressures on \nbiodiversity while promoting more sustainable \ndevelopment.\nConservation policies must therefore be aligned \nwith development needs in a region that is aiming \nfor economic growth of between 6 and 8% by 2035, \nand this within an unprecedented health context \nthat makes the future of protected area management \nuncertain. Listening to and taking into account the \nneeds of rural communities, helping them to develop \ntheir skills, participating in the financing of sustain-\nable agricultural sectors, mobilizing nature-based \nsolutions such as agroforestry, etc., are all avenues that \ngovernments and their partners can explore and which \nwill have beneficial repercussions on environmental \nprotection. Beyond the achievement of the Aichi \nTargets or the 30x30 objective, the Central African \nprotected area network only can have a real positive \nimpact on the environment if its managers make it \npart of territorial connectivity and succeed in putting \nhumans back at the heart of their environment."}

The process \nrelated to the creation of protected areas has not taken this reality into account, \nthus carrying within itself the seeds of separation between humans and nature \n(Monpetit, 2013). Consequently, rural communities often have been excluded from \nthe decision-making processes and the management of protected areas as well as \nthe\u00a0resources they relied on to survive.

Status of the governance \nof\u00a0protected areas in Central Africa\nSince 1990, the governance of protected areas \nin the subregion has been undergoing profound \nchanges (Table\u202f4 and Figure\u202f1). Although \u00ad\ncentralized \npublic governance remains the dominant model, it \nhas evolved significantly. In 1990, most countries \nmanaged protected areas through a government \ndepartment. Taking its lead from DRC, a pioneer in \nthis field (1934), several countries have created a state \ninstitution with independent management (insti-\ntute, agency, office): Rwanda (1973), Burundi (1980), \nGabon (2002), Equatorial Guinea (2002) and Congo \n(2012). Currently, the large majority of protected \nareas are managed by an agency (Figure\u202f2).\nTable\u202f4 - Number of protected areas by governance category in Central Africa  \nbetween 1990 and 2020\nYear\nPublic\nShared\nPrivate\nCommunity\nMinistry\nAgency\nPPP\nCommunities\n1990\n64\n58\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2020\n69\n117\n26\n3\n1\n2\nSource: OFAC.\nFigure\u202f1 - Distribution of Central African protected areas  \nby governance category in 2020\nI Public   I Shared   I Private   I Community\nTotal = 206\n85 %\nSource: OFAC."}

The governance \nof protected areas can be shared between the State \nand local communities or with private partners (in \nthe form of Public-Private Partnerships - PPP).  This \nform of governance has expanded significantly and \nis the dominant form in the subregion (Figure\u202f3). \nDRC has been a PPP pioneer since 2005, with the \nsigning of two agreements for Garamba and Virunga \nNational Parks.

Kakule, Tayna Nature Reserve\nBorn out of a desire to protect nature, the animals (including gorillas), but also the human inhabitants \nwho depend on natural resources for their survival, Tayna Nature Reserve was created in 1998 on the \ninitiative of the future chief conservation officer of the reserve and two traditional chiefs. \nThe first phase of the project was conducted in collaboration with the bami, community leaders. Through \ninterviews, surveys and workshops, an inventory of the population\u2019s expectations and needs for the \nreserve was drawn up. Local communities articulated several conditions for the creation of this reserve, \nincluding its appropriation by the population and the possibility of acting for the protection of protected \nspecies, poverty reduction (thanks to the implementation of development projects, the construction of \nprimary schools, etc.) and the integration of Tayna into the international network of protected areas. \nThe management of the reserve was entrusted to the Tayna Gorilla Reserve Association (RGT), created \nby customary chiefs and landowners in 2002. The management model chosen is a community-based \nmanagement system. The board of directors of the association is made up of local chiefs, bringing \ntogether the 21 \u201clanded\u201d chiefs, and reports to the College of Founders, the final decision-maker. In the \nfield, the RGT\u2019s actions are carried out by the technical team led by a coordinator. This team consists of \nabout 60 agents spread over different sites, with technical support from ICCN. \nLocal authorities, such as the political-administrative and customary authorities of the Lubero territory, \nwere involved from the onset and participated in drafting the reserve\u2019s management plan with govern-\nment partners.

{"text":"81\nLossi Gorilla Sanctuary (Congo): current governance\nN. Gami, Consultant anthropologist\nAn original and innovative story\nIn northern Congo spanning 350\u2009\nkm2, the Lossi Gorilla Sanctuary lies in the south of the \nOdzala-Kokoua National Park. Between 1992 and 1997, a lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla \ngorilla) habituation experiment took place, supported by Central African Forest \u00ad\nEcosystems \nprogram (ECOFAC), funded by the European Union (Gami, 2003).\nThe site chosen covers clan lands of the Mboko Alengui communities. These have a very \nstrong sense of land ownership, managed by the rights holders. Hence, rules based on \ncustomary law set out the terms of inheritance or land appropriation by individuals. The \ngorilla habituation pilot experiment, in interaction with foreign researchers and with the \nsupport of an anthropologist, led to the creation in Congo, for the first time, of a protected \narea at the request of the local community owning the land (1996).\nThis local community is explicitly involved in the management of the gorilla sanctuary, \nincluding decision making and the sharing of revenues generated by ecotourism. The \nmodalities of participation - a first in Congo - are specified in Decree No. 2001-222 of \n10\u202fMay 2001, establishing the sanctuary (Articles 3 and 11). Article 11 stipulates in particular: \n\u201cA memorandum of understanding sets out the forms of involvement of the local commu-\nnity, the partnership model to be put in place and the nature of the benefits derived by the \nvillage communities in the management of the sanctuary\u201d.\nWhat has become of this pilot experiment in the Congo?\nUnfortunately, following the devastating effects of the Ebola epidemics, the communities \nnow feel abandoned. Indeed, in December 2001, the first Ebola hemorrhagic fever epidemic \nin the Congo broke out in the Districts of Mbomo and Kell\u00e9.

These outbreaks led to the loss of the habituated gorilla group, which \nwas named \u201cApollo\u201d. This group was the sanctuary\u2019s main tourism attraction, bringing in \nsignificant revenue for the communities.\nFollowing these epidemics, the support needed to sustain this pilot experience disappeared. \nThe primatology researchers left the area and moved to the outskirts of the sanctuary, and \nthe financial support that the project initially received dried up. A government-appointed \nconservation officer oversees the Sanctuary, but there is a serious lack of financial and \nlogistical resources to revitalize the site. And shared governance is at a standstill.\nThe Lossi Sanctuary is a good example of the lack of long-term vision and support needed \nfor the establishment of shared, or even community, governance of some protected areas \nin Central Africa. This sanctuary needs to be revitalized through financial and technical \nsupport to restore the confidence of the Mboko Alengui community and enable them to \nreclaim the future of the site. While a minimum of financial resources is required, support \nto local communities is particularly important in terms of institutions, governance, manage-\nment and planning, the resumption of the habituation of gorilla groups and the revival of \ntourism activities.

{"text":"82\nadhere. These experiences have led WWF to develop \na guide for managers and policy makers to help them \ndevelop shared governance systems in protected areas \n(WWF,\u00a02013). \nOne of the main expected outcomes of all these \nshared local governance projects is a change in the \nbehavior of local communities, leading to greater \nacceptance of conservation actions and protected \nareas; shared governance of natural resources can be \nmore effective than governance that excludes rural \ncommunities (Kairu et al., 2021). However, this objec-\ntive faces several difficulties, including the expectation \nof tangible benefits that would enable communities to \nescape the extreme poverty in which they are trapped. \nMoreover, in many cases, the populations concerned \ntake a wait and see approach at best.

Indeed, \napart from the specifications formulated by the public \nparty, the private party often has a great deal of room \nof leeway at the decision-making level.\nGenerally speaking, private governance is seen by \nsome protected area managers as a source of problems, \ninsofar as field experiences have shown, particularly in \nNorth Cameroon, that some private operators often \ndo not respect their terms of reference.

{"text":"86\nMbou-Mon-Tour: an example of community biodiversity governance in DRC\nV. Omasombo and J.-C. Bokika-Ngawolo, MMT, V. Narat, CNRS\nThe Congolese NGO Mbou-Mon-Tour (MMT) operates mainly in the North Bateke chiefdom, \nBolobo Territory, Mai-Ndombe Province (DRC). Following local observations of dwindling \nanimal resources, this NGO was created in 1997, initially as a development NGO, to set up \nalternative subsistence activities. In 2001, MMT focused on the conservation of an emblematic \nspecies: the bonobo (Pan paniscus), whose presence was confirmed in 2005 by WWF.\nThe initiators of the project were villagers who either were from the area originally or were \nliving there. After experiencing a great deal of criticism and mistrust from various \u201cclassic\u201d \nconservation actors, MMT gradually succeeded in becoming a key player by proposing an \ninnovative model for the conservation of bonobos in DRC and, more generally, of great apes \nin Central Africa. \nIt quickly became apparent that the local communities were not in favor of creating a reserve \nor of extending the Tumba-Lediima reserve, as they wished to prevent the area from becoming \na classified forest under the Congolese forestry code and being shifted to central governance. \nIn order to be able to create a community conservation area, MMT relied on the Congolese \nforestry code, and in particular article 22, which stipulates: \u201cA local community may, at its \nrequest, obtain as a forest concession all or part of the protected forests among those usually \nowned by custom\u201d. The objective of creating this \u201cforest concession\u201d was community biodi-\nversity conservation and not artisanal timber exploitation, as is often proposed for the creation \nof community forests. \nThe creation process lasted approximately ten years, in parallel with the progress made in the \nproduction of regulatory texts relating to the modalities of allocation and management of \nLocal Community Forest Concessions (LCFC)."}

Participatory community governance was estab-\nlished, and in 2020 the inhabitants of the villages concerned elected the members of the three \ngovernance bodies from among their population.

This question mirrors \none raised previously in forestry, which has given rise \nto legislation on sustainable forestry and third-party \ncertification (Lescuyer, 2006). \nThe objectives of ZICs, and especially communi-\nty-managed ZICs, concern the development of sport \nhunting and a better distribution of revenues related \nto this activity (Van Vliet et al., 2017). In Cameroon, \nthe adoption of participatory management as a strong \nfocus of forest policy has led to the establishment of a \nnumber of pilot community-management initiatives. \nNotwithstanding the relatively complex process of \ncreating community-managed ZICs, their establish-\nment has had the advantage, particularly in southern \nCameroon, of providing communities with a better \nstructure for wildlife and income management, of \nencouraging the consideration of minorities and \naspects related to female representation in wildlife \nmanagement, of facilitating their awareness of the \nchallenges of sustainable wildlife management, and \nof generating tangible financial benefits within the \ncommunities, which are used for the implementation \nof development projects. However, this initiative has \nweaknesses, such as the low capacity for monitoring \nand community ownership in the implementation \nof micro-projects (supply of animal proteins, aqua-\nculture, beekeeping, etc.), the low level of collective \naction (individualism is still high) and the lack of \ntransparency in the management of the benefits. \n4.2.4 Governance by indigenous peoples \nand local communities\nIntroduced in the 1980s, this type of governance \nadvocates a participatory approach to biodiversity \nconservation and raises the issue of the real power \ngranted to local and indigenous populations.

In 2020, two protected areas benefited from \ncommunity governance: Tayna (see box in section \n4.1) and Kisimba Ikobo, both in DRC. However, \nother conservation initiatives are being developed \nthrough community forestry, which allows govern-\nance and management of forests to be assigned to \nrural communities. Using these legal provisions, \nvarious forests are being or have been conceded to \ncommunities for conservation and enhancement of \nforest ecosystem services, in Cameroon but especially \nin DRC. This is the case of the Mbali River forest, \ndeveloped by the NGO Mbou-Mon-Tour (see box). \nThis type of initiative, driven from the outset by the \nrural communities themselves, can inspire the crea-\ntion of community-based protected areas."}
{"text":"88\n5. Challenges related to the \nimplementation of protected area \ngovernance in Central Africa\nTo tackle biodiversity loss in Central Africa, \nreforms are needed to improve the governance of \nprotected areas (Zognou, 2020; COMIFAC-JICA, \n2020). As we have seen, this governance is evolving, \nwith an increasing mobilization of technical and \nfinancial partners through PPPs and a timid sharing \nof responsibilities with rural communities. \nBiodiversity conservation cannot be managed in a \ndisembodied way, and it involves a multitude of situ-\nations that must be managed on a case-by-case basis \nand the inclusion of local stakeholders (Boissi\u00e8re & \nDoumenge, 2008; Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2014a). \nHowever, very often, strict conservation is the main \nmanagement tool and governance remains in the \nhands of centralized state entities. Highly central-\nized institutions want to maintain their power over \nterritories and resources; they often are reluctant to \ndecentralize and devolve governance. This reflects an \napparent gap between the rhetoric of participatory \nmanagement and the reality of governance in many \nprotected areas (Petursson & Vedeld, 2017).\nParadoxically, any policy of decentralization and \ndevolution of responsibilities also requires a strong \ncentral power. However, this power must be exer-\ncised in other ways, by setting a legal and regulatory \nframework, by specifying the main principles of \nsustainable development and the framework for \nland use planning, by supporting local actors and by \nplaying its role of monitoring-evaluation-sanction, \netc. On the other hand, the legal status of protected \nareas and their ecological importance must be \nconsidered. Indeed, it could be quite possible that \nthe State retains governance and management \nresponsibility for protected areas of national interest \n(such as national parks), but favors the devolution \nof responsibilities for protected areas of more local \ninterest or with a conservation status allowing the \nexploitation of natural resources by local communi-\nties (protected areas in categories IV and VI of the \nIUCN classification, for example)."}

Private partners \nhave understood that it is necessary to guarantee \nthe application of laws but also to set up mecha-\nnisms allowing local communities to benefit from \nthe resources of protected areas (financial and other). \nHowever, this support should, on the one hand, enable \npublic services to strengthen their skills and operating \ncapacities and, on the other hand, facilitate the devo-\nlution of certain responsibilities to local communities. \nThe ultimate objective is to strengthen the skills, \ncapacities and responsibilities of national actors in the \nlong term (COMIFAC, n.d.; see also Chapter\u202f3).\nThe training of protected area managers also is \nan important issue, as it largely determines the effec-\ntiveness of management and its ability to adapt to \ncontexts.

{"text":"89\nThe greater involvement of rural and indigenous \ncommunities in the governance and management of \nprotected areas also requires appropriate teaching.

Proposals to improve \nthe\u00a0governance of Central African \nprotected areas\n6.1 The need for appropriate \nand\u00a0operational legislation\nThe legal framework for the governance of \nprotected areas dates back to the colonial period \n(Bigombe Logo et al., 2020). Various founding \ntexts (London Treaty of 1900, 1947 decree regu-\nlating hunting, etc.) established the sovereignty of \nthe colonial State over wildlife management and \nthe consecration of protected areas, in the modern \nsense of the term (Kamto, 1991), as instruments for \nthe preservation of species and the conservation of \nbiological diversity. After independence, the Central \nAfrican States adopted legislation which, although \nnew, was still largely inherited from these old texts. \nThe Rio Summit in 1992 and the holding of several \nWorld Parks Congresses have created favorable condi-\ntions for the integration and participation of populations \nand civil society in the governance of protected areas. \nThese texts reaffirm the sovereignty of States in the \nmanagement of protected areas, while strictly regu-\nlating the rights granted to biodiversity conservation \norganizations and to local and indigenous populations: \nconditions of collaboration for protected area manage-\nment, recognition of customary use rights, participation \nin the governance protected area institutions, etc. \nCurrently, these structural schemes are revealing \ntheir limitations (Nguiffo & Talla, 2010), as we have \nseen in the case of the Lake T\u00e9l\u00e9 Reserve. On the one \nhand, they are failing to halt the decline of wildlife, \ncontinued poaching and the erosion of biodiversity. \nOn the other hand, they do not allow protected areas \nto respond effectively to the legitimate expectations \nof States and local communities."}

This situation can \nbe explained by several factors, such as the increase \nin populations (notably migrations) on the edges \nor in protected areas, the advisory and non-deci-\nsional role attributed to certain organizations from \nindigenous populations and local communities, \nand the conflicts that still persist between certain \n\u00ad\ncommunities and\u00a0managers.\nThe effective governance of protected areas in \nCentral Africa therefore requires a thorough over-\nhaul, with revision and adaptation of the related legal \nframework. This process must promote and fine tune \nthe framework for shared governance of protected \nareas between States, biodiversity conservation \norganizations, civil society and local and indigenous \npopulations. Among other things, the reform should \ntranslate into the implementation of simplified and \ncoherent statute laws and by-laws that are custom-\nized and operational.

{"text":"91\nIn order progress further, indigenous people and \nlocal communities must become aware of their rights \nand, in parallel, of the challenges of protected area \nconservation. These populations need to know their \nrights better so that they can make their voices heard. \nThis will allow them to become actors of change for \nthe implementation of governance where they would \nbe able to play a full role. In addition, environmental \nand conservation awareness helps to improve the \ndialogue between conservationists and rural commu-\nnities, and ideally to build acceptance of the need for \na protected area. In the long run, this may have the \neffect of limiting conflicts between managers and \nthese populations.\n6.3 Rebuilding institutional \ncoordination at all territorial levels\nThe improvement of the governance of protected \nareas also requires the reorganization of the regional \ninstitutional coordination of the Central African \nprotected area network. Better coordination of the \nwork of the various cooperation actors involved in \nprotected area complexes (often transboundary) is \na guarantee of efficiency and success. For example, \nin the case of the BSB Yamoussa Complex, the two \nprotected areas concerned (Bouba-Ndjida and Sena \nOura) have a different type of governance (shared; \nsee section 3.2) from that of the complex itself (state). \nFaced with such a situation, transboundary coop-\neration and coordination are needed to achieve the \nobjectives of each protected area at the individual \nlevel and the complex at the binational level.  \nA wide range of actors are involved in the govern-\nance and management of protected areas. This \nabundance of actors, if not well synergized, can reduce \nthe effectiveness of regional cooperation actions due to \nredundant or contradictory actions. The establishment \nand\/or strengthening of consultation and coordina-\ntion frameworks at various levels (meetings, sharing \nof experiences, legal agreements, etc.) is essential to \nbetter coordinate actions, harmonize interventions \nand seek synergy between all stakeholders."}

The \nestablishment of decentralized territorial authorities \nand the empowerment of local actors (communities, \netc.) should make it possible to avoid duplication of \nefforts by encouraging a search for complementa-\nrity and by orienting interventions according to the \ndefined objectives. This would allow for a progressive \nempowerment of local actors in the management of \nprotected areas, the harmonization of interventions \nand approaches, and the optimization of the mobi-\nlization of human, technical and financial resources. \n6.4 Stakeholder support\nAs we have seen previously, technical, material, \nfinancial and human support over the medium-long \nterm is key to setting up a governance that is better \nshared between various stakeholders. Project-based \nprogramming spanning three to five years is not \nadapted to this need and is even counterproductive. \nPublic planning, cooperation agreements, actions to \nsupport rural communities, etc., must be programmed \nover a minimum of ten years.

In order to facilitate the evolution \nof protected area governance towards more equity and \njustice, the development of training, whether through \nworkshops, internships, or short courses for example, \nmust be considered. The training courses dedicated \nto future protected area managers, whether they are \nuniversity courses or not (for example, short MOOC-\nstyle courses or other types), can be improved in a \nnumber of ways. It appears that new graduates lack \npractical experience and knowledge of the field, \nknowledge of how to manage the budgets they will be \nresponsible for and understanding of relations with \nother stakeholders. Moreover, the involvement of \nrural actors, who are often poorly trained or even illit-\nerate (but in possession of incomparable \u00ad\nknowledge"}

Conclusion\nIn Central Africa, we have seen that the govern-\nance systems of protected areas are complex, based \non complex interactions between institutional \nstructures and actors with divergent and overlap-\nping interests and norms. Over the past thirty years, \nthese systems have evolved significantly, although \nin different ways. Public governance is now leaning \nmore towards governance by an independent agency \nrather than a ministerial department. Shared govern-\nance has developed but mainly in the framework \nof public-private partnerships with international \norganizations. The sharing of responsibilities with \nlocal communities is being tested in various sites \nbut is still in its infancy. Finally, one protected area \nwith private governance and two with community \ngovernance were identified.\nThus, the governance of protected areas in the \nsubregion is undergoing profound change. Central \nAfrica is now at a crossroads in finding the right \ngovernance model reflecting the realities of  the variety \nof human and ecological contexts. Although there is \nstill a long way to go, in some cases it is increasing \nwelfare and social equity for people and significantly \nreducing threats and pressures on protected areas. \nWhat appears to be a fundamental condition \ntoday is the pursuit of reforms within governance \nsystems so that they match local contexts. Given \nthe considerable weight of traditional customs and \npractices and the esteem in which the institution of \ntraditional chieftaincy is held, as well as the dogma \nof religion within communities bordering protected \nareas, it is desirable that reform action be put in place \nto make traditional norms more compatible with the \nrequirements of modern governance of protected \nareas (Bigombe Logo, 2012; Kwesi, 2007)."}

In reality, \nshared governance was developed in the PPP frame-\nwork with international actors, but has been slow \nto take shape with rural communities. Despite the \ncommitments made by governments, many protected \nareas are still under government governance (85%),or \nhave government representatives on their governance \nbody (almost 100%). Cameroon, CAR, Sao Tome and \nPrincipe and Chad only have protected areas whose \ngovernance is a centralized state model (ministry); \nthe other countries have switched to a governance by \nagency model."}
{"text":"93\nHowever, the growth of shared private and \ncommunity governance systems is involving a greater \nnumber of actors and constitutes a step towards the \nbetter integration of protected areas in multi-actor \nterritorial management. Shared governance can be \nobserved within ZICs and involves private actors \nbut also communities and decentralized adminis-\ntrations. Private governance as such remains almost \nnon-existent (except, in fact, in some ZICs), which is \na major difference with southern Africa, for example \n(Bauer et al. 2020). As for community governance of \nprotected areas, it is slowly emerging, particularly in \nDRC and Congo, which are pioneers in this regard. \nWhether the model in question is one of shared \ngovernance or governance by indigenous peoples \nand local communities, models that include these \ncommunities hold the greatest potential for positive \nimpacts on natural resource conservation and on the \nwell-being of people. By taking their needs and rights \ninto account, the risks of conflicts between these \ncommunities and protected areas are limited. When \nlocal communities become actors in the governance \nand management of protected areas, other governance \nactors can benefit from their know-how and their \nhands-on knowledge of the natural environment and \nits specific characteristics. \nIt is not enough to engage in dialogue with the \nlocal communities. It is essential to give legitimacy \nto their voice by supporting them in the develop-\nment of the skills they need to participate in the \nprotected area governance, to officially recognize \ntheir status as rights holders, and to give them a role \nin the decision-making process. As we have seen \nin this chapter, many protected areas are currently \nmoving in this direction, but none has proven yet to \npropose a sufficiently successful system in terms of \neffective local communities\u2019 involvement. Enabling \nthese communities to participate effectively in \nthe governance and decision making of protected \nareas that are part of their living environment \ncontinues to be a major challenge for the countries \nof Central Africa."}

{"text":"100\n100\nWildlife populations in protected areas have long remained relatively stable in \nCentral Africa (Scholte, 2011). This situation is rapidly changing, and Central Africa \nis now confronted with declining and even collapsing wildlife populations. Since \nthe\u00a01980s, most of the dry savanna protected areas have lost 80% of their antelope \npopulations, with declines in the sub-humid savanna protected areas occurring \nsince the 1990s (Plumptre et al., 2007; Scholte, 2013). Lions have gone extinct \nin\u00a0over 60% of protected areas in West and Central Africa over the last forty years \n(Brugi\u00e8re et al., 2016). Long-term surveys of forest wildlife show more recent rapid \ndeclines: for example, forest elephant populations that have dropped by 60% \nbetween 2002 and 2011, including in protected areas (Maisels et al., 2013). Amongst \nseveral underlying drivers or root causes of these changes, we earlier identified: \n1) poor incentives, including wildlife laws, regulations, conflicts and corruption, \nwhich limit investing in wildlife conservation, and 2) chronic underfunding, most \nCentral African protected areas running on an estimated 10% of the necessary funds \n(Balmford et al., 2003; Norton-Griffiths, 2007; Scholte, 2011; Scholte et al., 2018).\nPartnerships with private organizations have been \nsuggested to be a means to address the root causes, \ni.e., \u201cpoor incentives\u201d and \u201cunderfunding\u201d, as not-for-\nprofit organizations generally are distinguished by \ntheir technical expertise and credibility in the eyes \nof international funding agencies compared to often \nhighly centralized bureaucratic governmental organ-\nizations (Hatchwell, 2014; Saporiti, 2006; Baghai \net\u00a0 al., 2018; Scholte et al., 2018). Since the early \n2000s, protected area authorities in some 12 countries \nin sub-Saharan Africa have delegated park manage-\nment to international non-governmental private \npartners."}

While Malawi and Zambia led the way in \nSouthern Africa to adopt such partnerships, Central \nAfrican countries hesitated to embrace delegated \nmanagement to help restore their parks. Delegated \nmanagement has long been perceived as \u201callowing \nforeigners to take over our national parks\u201d. Doubts \nabout its feasibility and desirability continues to \nreign amongst protected areas authorities in Central \nAfrican countries, such as Cameroon and Gabon. \nIn 2005, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n(DRC) took the lead in Central Africa, contracting \nAfrican Parks Network (APN) for the management \nof Garamba National Park and Virunga Foun-\ndation for the management of Virunga National \nPark. Since 2010, the DRC has been joined by an \nincreasing number of Central African countries, \nsuch as Chad, Rwanda, Congo and Central African \nRepublic (CAR), which have initiated Public-\u00ad\nPrivate \nPartnerships (PPP) (Figure\u202f1). As of July 2020, \n13 partnerships have been contracted (the 14th at \nNyungwe National Park in Rwanda is imminent), \nmanaging a total area of c. 205,000\u2009km2, the size of \nSenegal.

These \ndiscussions figured prominently at the annually held \nCoCo-Congo (Community Conservation Congo) \nconference in 2013-2015, where the Institut Congo-\nlais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN), the \nprotected areas authority, met up with its partners to \ndiscuss ongoing topics.\nIn 2014, regional discussions were initiated by \nthe Network of Central African Protected Areas \n(RAPAC) in Douala, Cameroon.

In October \n2017, actors involved in the management of Deng \nDeng National Park (created as an offset of a hydro-\nelectric scheme), in close collaboration with the \nhydroelectric company, organized a national meeting \nto keep Cameroonian authorities informed about \nexperiences with delegated management.\nIn December 2017, the Sub-working group \non protected areas and wildlife (SGAPFS) of \nCOMIFAC took the initiative to develop \u201cBest prac-\ntices for the management of protected areas through \npublic-private partnerships in Central Africa\u201d. This \nprocess incorporated two workshops (December 2017 \nin Libreville, and April 2018 in Douala) resulting in \nguidelines that were further developed, published and \nadopted by COMIFAC\u2019s Board of Ministers in July \n2019 (COMIFAC, 2018).\nAlongside these initiatives, we collected details \non Central African protected areas partnerships, \ncompiled external evaluations from the partnerships \nand tried to draw further lessons. This allowed a first \ncomparison with protected areas partnerships else-\nwhere in Africa, highlighting regional differences and \npossible solutions (Scholte et al., 2018).\nThe present chapter builds on these PPP review \ninitiatives, presents new data on partnership \ncontracts, and provides subsequent insights that may \nassist the further development of these partnerships. \nIt thereby provides an overview of partnership expe-\nriences and allows to draw lessons from this form of \nmanagement as it applies to the specific ecological \nand socio-\u00ad\neconomic context of Central Africa. This \nshould lead to a deeper understanding of delegated \nmanagement and allow governmental bodies to be \nin a better position to take informed decisions on \npossible delegated management of one or more of \nits protected areas.

In the last section (4), \nwe explore improved practices and models in which \nthe COMIFAC guide on best-practices plays a \ncentral role.

{"text":"103\n103\n1. Management types  \nof protected areas\n1.1 Sovereignty, ownership, governance \nand management\nWe concentrate in this chapter on partnerships \nthat delegate operational management of a protected \nareas to a private partner, and generally share gover\u00ad\nnance between the public and private partners. Before \ndiscussing these differences, it is important to keep \nin mind the overarching dimensions of \u00ad\nsovereignty \nand ownership which concern all protected areas. \nEach country is sovereign in its legislation that all, \nincluding management and governance bodies, have \nto comply with, be it under private or state manage-\nment, governance or ownership. Ownership of all \nprotected areas in Central Africa lies, to the best \nof our knowledge, with the State. The State may be \nrepresented by the ministry in charge of wildlife or \na dissolved body such as an \u201cagency\u201d or \u201coffice\u201d in \ncharge of protected areas.\nIn Chapter\u202f2, the governance of protected areas \nin Central Africa was presented, and we refer back \nto it for specific details. For our discussion about \nPPP management modes, we refer to the framework \nprovided in Figure\u202f2. There are three variations of \ngovernance and management arrangements, namely:\n1.\tStrategic governance and operational management \nare shared between the public partner and the \nprivate partner;\n2.\tStrategic governance is shared between the public \npartner and the private partner and operational \nmanagement is delegated to the private partner. \nThis is the main partnership mode considered in \nthis chapter;\n3.\tStrategic governance and operational management \nare delegated to the private partner.\nFigure\u202f2 \u2013 Modes of strategic governance and operational management\nDelegation of GOVERNANCE\nDelegation of MANAGEMENT\n1.

{"text":"104\n104\n1.2 Management modes of Central \nAfrican protected areas\nThe following four management modes have \nbeen identified in Central African protected areas \n(COMIFAC, 2018):\na.\u202fPublic management by a department of the \nministry responsible for biodiversity conservation and \nprotected areas management. This is the mode that \nhistorically prevailed in all Central African countries, \nand which remains in place in Burundi, Cameroon, \nCAR and Sao Tome and Principe;\nb.\u2009Management by an agency, a specialized tech-\nnical body of the supervising ministry with a certain \ndegree of administrative and financial autonomy. \nHistorically, DRC was the first country in Central \nAfrica to adopt this type of institution with the \nestablishment in 1975 of what is now named ICCN. \nRwanda followed, and more recently Gabon, Congo \nand Equatorial Guinea have set up national agencies;\nc.\u2009Community management, a rare mode of \nmanagement in Central Africa from a formal stand-\npoint, limited to a few isolated cases, such as the Tayna \nNature Reserve (DRC) and the Lac Tele Community \nReserve (Congo);\nd.\u2009Public-private \npartnership \nmanagement, \nwhich began developing in 2005 in DRC, followed \nby Congo, Rwanda, Chad, and most recently CAR \n(Figure\u202f1).\nAll Central African protected areas are under \npublic governance, community or shared. The absence \nof protected areas under private governance is striking \nconsidering that this category is widespread and even \ngrowing in Southern and Eastern Africa (Bond et al., \n2004). This is largely linked to the nature of the land \ntenure: in Spanish (Equatorial Guinea) and French-\nspeaking Central African countries, private land \nownership rights are very restrictive. Unlike several \ncountries in English-speaking areas (South Africa, \nNamibia, Kenya), there are no large private proper-\nties which have been converted, all or in part, into a \nprotected area by their owners.\nIt should be noted that several management modes \nmay be found within the same country and in the same \nprotected area category."}

The exception is the combi-\nnation of the \u201cpublic management\u201d and \u201cmanagement \nby an agency\u201d modes as they are \u00ad\nmutually exclusive \nwithin the same protected area category. In Rwanda, \nfor example, the management of national parks is the \nresponsibility of the Rwanda Development Board \n(RDB). RDB directly manages Volcanoes National \nPark under the \u201cmanagement by an agency\u201d mode, \nhowever, it subcontracts the management of Akagera \nNational Park to African Parks Network under the \n\u201cPPP management\u201d mode. Meanwhile the manage-\nment of wetlands, including a Ramsar site (Rugezi \nMarsh), is supervised by the Rwanda Environ-\nmental Management Authority (REMA) under the \n\u201cmanagement by an agency\u201d mode. In Gabon, the \nAgence Nationale de Pr\u00e9servation de la Nature  (ANPN) \nmanages the national parks under the \u201cmanagement \nby an agency\u201d mode while the Direction de la Faune \net des Aires Prot\u00e9g\u00e9es (DFAP) under the Ministry of \nWater and Forests oversees other types of protected \nareas managed under a \u201cpublic management\u201d mode.\nCentral African protected areas have a long history \nof \u201cproject\u201d style technical assistance, traditionally in \ncombination with the \u201cpublic management\u201d mode. \nNonetheless, the three other management modes also \nhave received assistance from projects, which some-\ntimes makes it difficult to distinguish the difference \nbetween management modes, especially the \u201cPPP \nmanagement\u201d mode."}

They differ from \nconventional practices in terms of the planning and \nexecution of works and provision of public services \ndue to the strong involvement of various institu-\ntions or organizations from the private sector (in the \nbroad sense including private companies, founda-\ntions, NGOs, etc.). This involvement occurs through \nthe whole or partial delegation of the responsibility \nof the government as contracting authority to a \nprivate entity, which may take place in various ways \n(see Figure\u202f2).\nIn general, one speaks of PPP when the public and \nprivate sectors collaborate under a contract to carry \nout infrastructure projects such as roads, railways, \nhospitals, schools, etc. (SETYM International, 2012). \nThese projects are subject to the signing of long-term"}
{"text":"105\n105\ncontracts between a public authority and a private \nsector company. One of the distinguishing features of \nthis management mode is the transfer to the private \npartner of certain risks associated with the project, \nin particular its design, construction, management \nand operation and maintenance. The private partner \ncommits, in terms of outputs and performance, to \ncarry out the project in question. Furthermore, the \nprivate partner seeks to obtain the required funding. In \nreturn, the public partner agrees to pay a renumeration \nto the private partner. This renumeration must reflect \nthe performance of the services effectively rendered.\nLong-term technical assistance and public-private partnership:  \nwhat is the difference?\nA large number of Central African protected areas receive support from technical and financial \npartners in the form of projects. A \u201cproject\u201d is a kind of financial assistance that is defined in \ntime and space and targets specific actions laid out in a \u201cproject document\u201d. These projects \ngenerally are implemented by technical partners \u2013 Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) \nor consulting firms \u2013 which deploy a team of technical assistants who provide support to the \ngovernment employees managing the protected area.\nWhile the duration of the projects is generally relatively short (3-4 years), the technical part-\nners nonetheless can manage to secure a series of funding which enables them to provide \nlong-term technical and financial support. For example, two NGOs, the World Wide Fund \nfor Nature (WWF) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) respectively have provided \nuninterrupted support to the protected areas of Dzanga-Sangha (CAR) and Nouabale-Ndoki \n(Congo) since the areas were established (in 1990 and 1993, respectively).  These two NGOs \nrecently negotiated to change their support from the project form to a PPP arrangement, and \ncontracts were signed to this end in 2013 (WCS) and 2019 (WWF).\nWhat difference does this make compared to long-term technical assistance? First, the \ncontract establishes official governance and operational management entities in the protected \nareas that did not necessarily exist previously. Through the contract, the State then formally \ndelegates part of its prerogatives to the private partner."}

First, the \ncontract establishes official governance and operational management entities in the protected \nareas that did not necessarily exist previously. Through the contract, the State then formally \ndelegates part of its prerogatives to the private partner. This mainly concerns two domains: i) \nmanagement of protected area staff (including government employees), which passes under \nthe direct authority of a director representing the private partner; and ii) securing long-term \nfunding, which becomes the sole responsibility of the private partner. The last point is crucial: \ngiven the inefficiencies of Central African States in terms of financial governance, it is expected \nthat the credibility of the private partner will lead to substantial private and public funding and \nthat this partner will ensure efficient and transparent management.\nIt should be acknowledged that in the case of long-term technical assistance, the private \npartner already de facto provides and manages most of a protected areas\u2019 funding, and also \nsets up forms of shared governance of the protected area through one or several project \nsteering committees, for example.  In this case, the real novelty is above all the transfer of the \nresponsibility of the protected area\u2019s entire staff to the private partner.\nIn general, three key elements constitute a PPP:\n\t\n\u2013 There is a contractual document between the public and private partners that clearly defines \nthe roles, responsibilities and commitments of the two parties;\n\t\n\u2013 The public partner delegates to the private partner all or part of its prerogatives, in particular \nthe management of the protected area\u2018s staff (including government employees);\n\t\n\u2013 The private partner provides or raises funding and manages the funds necessary for the \noperational management of the protected area (investment and operations)."}
{"text":"106\n106\nThe efficiency of this type of partnership has \nbeen the main reason for the model\u2019s application to \nprotected areas which have been underfunded and \ndeprived of investments for a long time. However, \nthe PPPs currently in place in Central Africa are all \nnot-for-profit. Any revenue from the partnership is \nfirst invested in the protected area before being used \nto potentially provide support to communities on the \noutskirts of the protected area or the public partner \n(case of DRC).\nThis management mode requires more in-depth \npreparation and planning than conventional manage-\nment modes, and the appropriate management of the \nprocurement stage. This approach makes it possible to \nstimulate competition between candidates. However, \nthe use of competitive procedures is not yet common \nin PPPs applied to Central African protected areas. \nIndeed, all PPPs currently in place were concluded \nthrough single source negotiation processes and not \ncalls for tenders.\nExamples include the case of APN for Akagera \nNational Park in Rwanda, Zakouma National Park \nin Chad, Chinko Nature Reserve in CAR, Garamba \nNational Park in DRC, and Odzala National Park \nin Congo (Figure\u202f1). At present, two contracts are \nbeing prepared following a call for tenders, Nyungwe \nNational Park (in Rwanda) with APN and Conk-\nouati-Douli National Park (in Congo) with No\u00e9 \n(a\u00a0French NGO registered in Congo). Unfortunately, \ntheir contract negotiations were delayed due to the \nCovid-19 pandemic.\n1.4 Public-private partnership, \ndelegated management \nor\u00a0co-management? \nStudies focussing on public-private partnerships \nfor the management of protected areas often seek \nto establish a typology based on different criteria \n(governance arrangements, operational management, \nfinancing, etc.). The terms \u201cdelegated management\u201d \nand \u201cco-management\u201d thus appear often to distin-\nguish the degree of collaboration between the two \npartners.

(2018) note that in the delegated \nmanagement model, the governance structure is \ncharacterized by a majority of members appointed \nby the private partner. The latter also appoints the \nsenior officials of the operational management \nentity and has full responsibility for the opera-\ntional management of the protected area. In the"}
{"text":"107\n107\nco-\u00ad\n\u00ad\nmanagement model, the sharing of authority is \nmore balanced and the State retains its sovereign \nmissions: anti-poaching operations are directed by \nthe public authority which has the power to hire and \ndismiss its agents, while the partner can do the same \nwith its own contract staff.\nOn the basis of these two definitions, the afore-\nmentioned authors consider that the protected areas \nof Virunga and Salonga in DRC, and Dzanga-Sangha \nin CAR, fall under co-management, while the \nprotected areas of Akagera and Nyungwe (Rwanda), \nGaramba (DRC), Chinko (CAR), Zakouma (Chad), \nNouabale-Ndoki and Odzala-Kokoua (Congo) fall \nunder delegated management. Yet when the part-\nnership agreements are examined in detail, this \ncategorization no longer appears clear. While it is \ntrue that in Salonga and Virunga those responsible \nfor combatting poaching are appointed by the public \nauthority, this is also the case in Garamba (under \ndelegated management), but is not the case in Dzan-\nga-Sangha (nonetheless also under co-management), \nAkagera or Nyungwe. In terms of the composition \nof governance entities, the criterion of having the \nmajority of representatives appointed by the private \npartner for delegated management mode appears \nto be verified overall; however, this is also the case \nfor Dzanga-Sangha, which is nevertheless under \nco-management. \nOverall, in the co-management model, the public \npartner is more present and the key positions of oper-\national management fall within the public authority\u2019s \ndomain, in particular police operations, for which it is \nresponsible under the law.

It also helps \nto focus the attention of decision-makers and stake-\nholders on a few gaps and weaknesses that should be \navoided in each of the four phases of the development \nprocess of a PPP project.\nDepending on the approach and the type of \ngovernance adopted by the two parties, responsibilities \nare clearly divided between the State and the private \npartner and are laid down in the contract. The guide \nprovides directions and guidance on determining the \nduration of a contract and arrangements for sharing \nthe revenue generated. It also explains the sharing and \ntransfer of risk, the responsibility for law enforcement \nand other aspects of the relationship between the \npublic and private partners in the management of the \nprotected area.\nThe four phases of the development process of \na PPP protected area management project must be \nidentified and their implementation must be carefully \nprepared.\n4.1.1 Project identification  \nand preparation phase\nThe satisfactory implementation of a PPP project \nfor the management of a protected area fundamen-\ntally depends on the correct conduct of the initial \nproject identification and preparation phase. This \nphase should allow each of the partners in general, \nand in this case the public partner, to answer certain \nkey questions. At this point the task is to clearly deter-\nmine the motivations, objectives and main expected \noutcomes, as well as the skills and resources required \nfrom the private partner for their achievement.\nThe protected areas in the national network likely \nto be the subject of a PPP contract must be identi-\nfied.

Does delegated management \nsupplant the State or build its capacities? The eval-\nuation by the European Commission (2014) of \ndelegated management initiatives in DRC concluded \nthat, apart from undeniable strengths, weaknesses \ninclude the limited ownership by the protected area \nauthority.

{"text":"120\n120\n4.3 Towards other types of\u00a0partnerships\nAt present, delegated management holds a \nmonopoly on PPPs. This may be understandable \nwhere private partners have initiated conserva-\ntion activities in the area, as is the case with WWF \nin Dzangha-Sangha protected area (CAR) and \nWCS in Nouabale-Ndoki National Park (Congo). \nHowever, we wonder if this should automatically \ncontinue as partnerships mature and protected areas \nbecome more developed. In this respect, Garamba \nNational Park is an example where its first delegated \nmanagement contract in 2005 totalled seven pages, \nwhich tripled to 24 in 2016, with increased expecta-\ntions within the DRC.\nSome other types of partnerships may also be \nconsidered, depending on responsibilities handled to \nthe private partner or economic activity considered \n(Table\u202f5). These other types of contracts and economic \nmodels (Roulet, 2004 or Yasuda, 2012 on sport \nhunting, for example) will not be detailed here but \nthey might offer other opportunities for conservation \nthrough economic activities, which differ substantially \nfrom non-profit PPPs discussed in this chapter.    \nDeng Deng National Park in Cameroon:  \ntowards a new type of funding mechanism\nDeng Deng National Park in Cameroon was established in 2010 on 6,820\u2009\nkm2.

{"text":"122\n122\n5. Conclusions \nand recommendations\n5.1 Conclusions\nSince the establishment of the contracts for \nGaramba and Virunga National Parks in 2005, \npublic-private partnerships have become an impor-\ntant tool for the management of protected areas in \nCentral Africa. The six contracts that reached the \nend of their terms were all extended, unlike in other \nAfrican countries, notably Ethiopia.\nAfrican Parks Network dominated the PPP land-\nscape in Central Africa in the early years and remains \nan important actor, holding six of the 13 PPP contracts \nwhich are active in the sub-region. WWF and WCS, \nwhich also have been very present in this region for \ndecades through the provision of technical assistance, \nhave recently converted their historic collaboration in \ncertain protected areas into PPPs, which testifies to \nthe interest in this model. Furthermore, new actors \nare gradually emerging, such as Forgotten Parks (in \nDRC) and more recently No\u00e9 (in negotiations for two \nPPPs in Chad and Congo).\nSince the first partnership contracts were signed in \n2005, major changes have resulted in a second gener-\nation of contracts. This evolution notably includes \ngreater ownership by governments, which have \nformulated increasingly detailed expectations. The \nexample of the Garamba contract is instructive. In \n2005, it only contained seven pages without specific \nexpectations; in 2016, the contract had extended to 24 \npages and included specific targets.\nTo strengthen the appropriation of PPPs by \ngovernments, COMIFAC has developed a guide \nto best-practices for the management of protected \nareas through PPPs (available in French, Guide Sous-\u00ad\nR\u00e9gional de Bonnes Pratiques pour la Gestion des Aires \nProt\u00e9g\u00e9es en Mode Partenariat Public-Priv\u00e9 PPP en \nAfrique Centrale). The guide focuses on the prepara-\ntion of tender documents to draw the attention of \ndecision-makers to the gaps and weaknesses to be \navoided in each of the four phases of the development \nprocess of a PPP project.\nThe diversification of PPPs in Central Africa, \nmoving beyond the \u201ctotal\u201d delegated management \nmodel, remains tentative."}

A type of co-manage-\nment model is gradually emerging where roles and \n\u00ad\nresponsibilities are more shared by the two actors.\n5.2 Recommendations\nThe establishment of PPPs should preferably take \nthe form of a call for tenders open to national and \ninternational organizations. Allocation through single \nsource negotiations should remain the exception. A \nstandard tender document is available in the guide to \nbest practices for the management of protected areas \nthrough PPPs proposed by COMIFAC (2018).\nIt is crucial to be able to make management contracts \naccessible to the public \u201cupon reasonable request\u201d. \nOnly contracts concluded with APN and WWF were \nmade available to us, which makes the learning process \ndifficult. Furthermore, this lack of transparency is easily \ninterpreted as a desire to conceal something.\nIn contracts, the clauses relating to the respon-\nsibility of the two partners in the management of \nprotected area administrative and field staff (recruit-\nment, promotion, changes in posts, sanctions, \ndismissals, etc.) must be very clear so as not to leave \nroom for interpretation. This in particular concerns \ngovernment employees seconded to the private \npartner, whose management requires close collabora-\ntion between the two partners."}
{"text":"123\n123\nThe clauses relating to procedures for communi-\ncation between the two partners must be detailed in \nthe contracts. It is recommended that, in addition to \nkey events in the governance of the agreements (for \nexample, meetings of the Board of Directors), flex-\nible and partly informal arrangements for exchanges \nand communications be put in place between the two \npartners. This is particularly important during the first \nyears of the partnership when the two partners are \ngradually getting to know and trust each other.\nAlmost all contracts include regular evaluations, \noften in a five-year time frame. Unfortunately, this \nprovision often has not been fulfilled and when eval-\nuations are conducted, they have been hindered by \na lack of operational plans as they were supposed to \nbe drafted on the basis of these contracts that allow \ntracking contractual actions and other obligations. We \nrecommend a stricter application of the \u00ad\npossibilities \nthat (independent) evaluations offer.\nCapacity building, considered to be amongst the \nmost important part of the partnerships, has, to our \nknowledge, never been systematically evaluated. Part \nof the ongoing frustration with PPPs is the large \nnumber of expatriate staff in some of the contracted \nparks. The impression is that few partnerships have \ndeveloped systematic capacity building programs, \nalthough recently some initiatives have been taken \n(e.g., in Garamba National Park).\nUntil now, PPPs were established between States \nand NGOs. It would be interesting to test this model \nwith local authorities. Following a more or less gener-\nalized decentralization process in Central Africa, they \nare required to take on increasing responsibilities in \nterms of environmental management. Their expertise \nin this area is generally very limited and the establish-\nment of a PPP would be a good way for them to assume \ntheir responsibilities while improving their expertise \nthrough collaboration with an experienced partner.\nBibliography\nReferences cited in the text\nBaghai M., 2016.

{"text":"132\nBiodiversity conservation is a major challenge for policymakers in Central \nAfrican countries. In a context of chronic underfunding, information plays a \ncrucial role in ensuring the effectiveness of interventions and investments. \nThe use of information is vital for a number of reasons: information supports \nall decisions related to planning and management, it helps to target and \ncalibrate the efforts that need to be made, and it allows the impact of actions \nundertaken to be measured. Nonetheless, far too little attention and resources \nare devoted to information collection and information management.\nInformation can be considered as the \nresolution of uncertainty. The concept \nof information has\u00a0different meanings \nin\u00a0different contexts. In our case, \ninformation is\u00a0associated with data linked \nto understanding conceptual and concrete \nelements. The\u00a0more an element is uncertain, \nthe\u00a0more information is needed to resolve \nthis\u00a0uncertainty and to find a viable solution.\nThe very usefulness of having priority information \nfor the management and governance of protected areas \nis sometimes questioned. Many managers still see \ndata collection as an unnecessary activity that diverts \nresources from more important actions. Yet insuffi-\ncient information negatively impacts the quality of \nplanning, the identification of intervention priorities \nand, ultimately, the outcomes of actions undertaken.\nThis situation is mainly due to two factors. On the \none hand, there is a vicious circle in protected areas. \nA lack of information makes management more \ncomplicated, leading managers to work in a reactive \nmode, responding to problems as they happen rather \nthan taking a proactive approach with a long-term \nperspective. On the other hand, we still have in the \nframe of support projects in Central Africa insuffi-\ncient dialogue between protected area managers and \ninformation producers (experts, groups of special-\nists, biodiversity observatories, networks, etc.). The \nformer are not always able to clearly identify their \ninformation needs. The latter, in the absence of guid-\nance from managers and real benchmarks, are unable \nto focus their efforts on producing information \nthat could be directly useful in achieving desired \noutcomes in the field."}

The \nformer are not always able to clearly identify their \ninformation needs. The latter, in the absence of guid-\nance from managers and real benchmarks, are unable \nto focus their efforts on producing information \nthat could be directly useful in achieving desired \noutcomes in the field.\nThis undermines planning, monitoring, and \nevaluation capacities, reduces the ability to iden-\ntify \nmanagement \nobjectives \nand \ncomplicates \ndecision-making. A clear vision of conservation \nobjectives makes it possible to better develop the \nrationale behind an intervention and to formu-\nlate sound medium and long-term work programs \nat the level of both specific sites and protected area \nnetworks. The more management is proactive and \nadaptive, the more information needs will be targeted \nand reduced, and the more resources can be directed \ntowards achieving conservation objectives rather than \nresolving \u00ad\nshort-term problems.\nAdopting a proactive approach requires the mobi-\nlization and use of data.

Data processing and analysis\n5.1 Required skills\nInformation management is a complex process \nthat calls for a range of skills and requires the \ninvolvement of thematic experts, protected area \nmanagement experts, IT experts and statisticians \n(Figure\u202f2). Every national administration and \nregional monitoring agency should invest heavily \nin capacity building and ongoing training for the \nplanning, management, monitoring and evaluation \nof the institution itself.\nIt should be remembered here that statistics is a \npowerful tool that can greatly contribute to conserva-\ntion. At present, there are few, if any, national services \nthat rely on specialized statistical staff for monitoring \nand evaluation, at least in the field of conservation.\nImportance of integrating different tools and methods of analysis\nWhen assessing and analyzing field situations, it is possible to achieve important outputs by \nusing several approaches and tools or by relying on integrated approaches. These results \nwould be difficult to achieve if only one empirical approach or a single tool was used.\nFor example, during an IMET training program held in Bolivia, national managers wanted \nto begin a threat analysis exercise with a brainstorming session. The exercise was repeated \nseveral times using the \u00abthreat calculator\u00bb employed in IMET. The comparative analysis made \nit possible to identify three threats which had not been highlighted previously, one of which, \nconcerning overgrazing in community-managed areas, was particularly important.\nFigure\u202f2 \u2013 Different stages of information management and required skills\nData analysis and interpretation require input from experts in the fields \nof protected area management and conservation statistics. The conversion of analyses \ninto operational information requires consultation with managers. \nOperational information is the final element of the process, as are analyses and summaries \non particular subjects, for the benefit of decision-makers and managers.\nData processing requires computer skills for development. \nIt involves a series of processes that extract information or produce knowledge from raw data. \nFor advanced data processing, the contribution of a statistician is also useful. \nThe contribution of thematic experts is useful but is not decisive during this step.  \n Database structuring and organization require mainly statistical skills \nto prepare the data analysis and answer the questions asked.  \nData collection design requires technical and conceptual skills to identify priorities \nand target critical information needed by managers."}

{"text":"151\nAmong the many possibilities for further analysis \nand use of the information generated by processing \ndata collected, we would like to draw attention to the \nfollowing three types.\nAnalysis at the level of protected area \nsystems\nThe possibility of carrying out analyses at the level \nof protected area systems as a whole, whether at the \nlevel of landscapes or major biomes, as well as at the \nnational or at the regional level, undeniably offers great \nadded value. This scaling up of the analysis makes it \npossible to formulate more effective responses to \nquestions that arise at the level of the entire system \nconsidered. However, this change of scale is only \npossible if the analysis is based on information that \nis quantified and can be compared, and in Central \nAfrica, as in other regions, this is rarely the case.\nThis type of analysis is feasible only in the presence \nof databases which are structured in the same way, and \ndepends heavily on the willingness of national admin-\nistrations to share their data. In Burundi, for example, \nthis work made it possible to revise the national biodi-\nversity conservation strategy and to make the case for \nfunding needs based on well-\u00ad\ndocumented analyses \nand proposals. \nThese \ncomparative \nanalyses \nat \nthe \nlevels \nmentioned above facilitate dialogue with the inter-\nnational community and donors. They are crucial \nwhen deciding whether, where and how to finance \n\u00ad\nconservation projects. \nThis facilitates the monitoring of countries\u2019 imple-\nmentation of international commitments and makes \nit easier to prepare reports for the CBD or other \nagencies.

Although \nit could play the same role in conservation, some \nprotected area managers seem to tend to overlook its \nimportance.\nOne of the main reasons for this attitude is that \nwe believe that our knowledge and experience match \nthe information we need to manage. This confusion \nbetween necessary information and acquired knowl-\nedge does not exist in other fields of intervention where, \nto the contrary, knowledge is reinforced at the same \ntime that available information is sought and used.\nResearch and information management require \nsustainable resources and significant capacity on \nthe part of staff involved in the management of a \nprotected area. However, these resources are generally \ninsufficient and capacity building is often limited to \nanti-poaching activities. \nSeveral factors should be considered for the better \nuse of information in conservation:\n\u2022\t managers must understand that the knowl-\nedge-experience they have acquired can and must \nbe enriched with new information necessary for \nresults-oriented management;\n\u2022\t it is a mistake to think that information manage-\nment involves taking resources away from \u201cpriority\u201d \nmanagement activities. First of all, investing in the \ncollection and analysis of information is necessary \nfor better informed decision-making; it is a priority \nthat must be assumed as such. Second, investing \nin research and analysis of the information already \navailable, in synergy with the different actors \nand using existing information systems, does not \nrequire excessive efforts in terms of time, and even \nless in terms of money. A lot information is often \nalready available and can be generated without any \nkind of special contribution being requested from \nmanagement sites by website operators or observa-\ntories such as OFAC. The issue of what resources \nare available or are to be mobilized must be \nanalyzed above all with the objective of exploiting \nor rendering usable the information that is already \navailable rather than generating new information."}

{"text":"160\nConclusion\nInformation plays a crucial role in protected area \nmanagement and biodiversity conservation. However, \nfor its potential to be fully exploited and for managers \nand policy makers to achieve their goals and reverse \ncurrent trends, a change in culture is needed. Data \nproviders, managers and researchers must pull together \nand establish a dialogue that can ensure a contin-\nuous flow of information between all stakeholders. \nThis could generate a virtuous circle to better guide \nresearch and the collection of critical information, \nsupporting better planning that will enable actions \nin the field to be better targeted. These are the foun-\ndations of a proactive and results-oriented approach, \nbased on informed and effective decision-making.\nTo do so, it is essential to be able to rely on user-\nfriendly information systems, easy to access and \nsearch, based on well-structured databases from \nwhich information can be easily extracted. Above \nall, these databases must help to better present the \nreality on the ground. Through the analysis of this \ninformation, it will then be possible to formulate \nthe most appropriate operational recommendations \npossible with regard to the actions and strategies to \nbe implemented at the site, country and subregional \nlevels. While qualitative information can be useful for \ndecision-making, the use of quantitative information \nshould be improved. The latter allows for a simpler \nand finer representation of the situation as well as the \ncomparison, scaling and repetition of assessments. \n \nThe process should encourage a better use of infor-\nmation by enhancing the information that already \nexists, but also promote the collection and search for \nessential information that will enable better targeted \ninterventions.\nThe capacity to analyze the information avail-\nable and formulate operational recommendations is \nwithout doubt a critical component in the chain of \ninformation processing in which investments will \nbe essential. Human capacity building is undoubt-\nedly one of the priorities for intervention. OFAC \ncan and should play a central role in the region in \nthe management, analysis and flow of information, as \nwell as in capacity building, facilitating better coor-\ndination between different intervention levels and \nby supporting countries in their efforts to formulate \npriorities and policies.\nHowever, all of this alone is not enough."}

Countries \nneed to recognize and support the principles of data \nsharing and transparency, rendering data accessible to \nall stakeholders, of course while respecting the limi-\ntations imposed by sensitivity and security concerns. \nThis sharing would benefit above all the countries \nthemselves by enabling them to solicit both actors \nin the field and scientists. The resulting transparency \nand objective regional vision would facilitate dialogue \nand reciprocal trust between countries and donors, \ncontributing to a greater mobilization of resources for \nconservation."}

{"text":"176\nHuman-wildlife conflicts are ancient, but they are posing an increasing \nchallenge for conservation managers across Africa (Lamarque et al., 2009; \nNyhus, 2016; Shaffer et al., 2019). Human-wildlife conflicts can lead to a loss \nof biodiversity and a substantial decline in human well-being, most often for \npeople living near protected areas (Thirgood et al., 2005). Avoiding or solving \nthese conflicts are key issues for both protected area and wildlife managers.  \nConservation conflicts can be defined as \n\u201csituations that occur when two or more \nparties with strongly held opinions clash \nover conservation objectives and when one \nparty is perceived to assert its interests at the \nexpense of another\u201d (Redpath et al., 2013). \nConflicts and human-wildlife interactions include \nthree frames. The first consists of (illegal) human \nactivities involving wildlife (resource use) that lead to \nwildlife population disturbance and decline, and in the \nworst case, to species extinction. This is driven by an \noverall increase in the human population, particularly \nin sub-Saharan Africa, and an increasing need for land. \nThese issues are addressed by conservation managers in \ntheir daily work, as well as by anti-poaching measures, \nlaw enforcement efforts, and work with stakeholders \nto mitigate habitat loss and fragmentation, and to \neliminate retaliatory killing of wildlife. \nThe second frame consists of conflict arising \nfrom wildlife behavior directed at people and their \nbelongings with negative outcomes for people, their \nhealth and their livelihoods. This type of conflict \nusually involves crop raiding and livestock predation. \nThe third frame consists of conflicts between people \nover conservation, an often ignored but particularly \nimportant component of human-wildlife conflict. \nThis includes conflicts of interest, conflicts over beliefs \nand values, interpersonal conflicts, and conflicts over \ninformation. Thorough knowledge of all three frames \nand their underlying drivers is crucial to identify \nintervention priorities (Redpath et al., 2013, 2015; \nBaynham-Herd et al., 2018, 2020).\nOur current knowledge of human-wildlife conflict \nin Central Africa remains limited."}

Other species also are likely to pose different \ntypes of conflicts, for example livestock preda-\ntion by large carnivores such as lions and leopards \n(Panthera pardus), civet, etc. (Weladji & Tchamba, \n2003), or spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) around \ntourism camps and settlements. In this context, it is \nimportant to note that activities addressing various \nhuman-wildlife conflicts might involve completely \ndifferent mitigation techniques (e.g., guarding and \nfencing related to livestock). \nSince forest elephants are often mentioned as the \nnumber one conflict species in Central Africa, we \nbelieve that it is crucial to address this conflict, wherever \nit occurs. Measures to protect elephants increasingly \nhave been applied in recent years to combat wildlife \ncrime. While the impact of people on forest elephants \n(poaching, retaliatory killing, etc.) has dramatic impacts \non elephant populations and the ecosystem (Breuer \net al., 2016; Poulsen et al., 2018; Berzaghi et al., 2019), \nwe do not cover this wildlife crime aspect as it concerns \na completely different set of law enforcement actors \nand activities."}

In this \ncontext, protected areas are often falsely blamed for \nbeing responsible for conflict, whereas stakeholders \n(e.g., logging companies) responsible for wildlife \nmanagement in the land outside of protected areas \nare not doing enough to address the conflict. This \ncategory is applicable to the largest intact land-\nscapes in Western Equatorial Africa and is largely \nrelevant to wide-ranging species, such as elephants, \nmigratory herbivores, and large carnivores;\n3.\tHuman dominated multi-use landscapes, domi-\nnated by agricultural land and large commercial \nplantations: such situations are increasingly occur-\nring in Central Africa (Asaha & Deakin, 2016). \nHere, elephants are rare, and there is a conflict of \ninterest between farmers and those who wish to \nprotect the remaining elephant populations.\nFurthermore, it should be noted that many \nhuman-wildlife conflict studies and manuals mainly \nconcentrate on mitigation measures. However, these \ntechnical activities only treat the symptoms of the \nproblem (Barnes, 2002; Dublin & Hoare, 2004; \nHoare, 2015; Gross, 2019). The conflict lies at various \nlevels, and different activities going beyond miti-\ngation are needed to address conflict issues among \n\u00ad\nstakeholders and the underlying and deep-rooted \ncauses of conflict in order to transform conflict into \nco-existence (Madden & McQuinn, 2014, 2017; \nNyhus, 2016; Frank et al., 2019).\nIn the following, we cover three objectives and \nprovide various recent case studies related to human-\nforest elephant conflict.

{"text":"179\n1. Historical and current patterns \nof\u00a0human-forest elephant conflict \nin Central Africa\nRelatively little is documented about the history \nof human-elephant conflict in Central Africa despite \nits occurrence since pre-colonial times (Barnes, 1996; \nLahm, 1996). Elephants have been hunted for tusks, \nmeat, fat, and bones throughout their range. The \nkilling of elephants by the Baka and Aka tribes was a \nwidespread cultural tradition (Agam & Barkai, 2018) \nand is still an important part of their cultural heritage \n(Tsuru, 1998). However, the colonial ivory trade \nresulted in the removal of millions of forest elephants \nand many of the large tuskers (Poulsen et al., 2018).\nIn the past, human-elephant conflict may have \nexisted, but it was likely to be of little concern \u2013\u202feven \nin the largest palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) or rubber \n(Hevea brasiliensis) plantations\u202f\u2013 as elephants were \nsimply shot when they approached fields. Elephants \nlikely avoided human settlements, resulting in little \nhuman-elephant conflict. Furthermore, local people \nwere regularly resettled along roads and to urban \ncenters both before and after the colonial period. This \nresulted in huge remote forests (with large tracks of \nsecondary forest that are preferred by forest elephants) \nwith very few people and very limited access (large \nareas of Southern Cameroon, Gabon and Northern \nCongo) that contained large elephant populations \nresiding at high densities (e.g., Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 forest in \nNortheast Gabon). \nPoaching for ivory was common but occasional. \nSport hunting was performed by expatriate employees \nof logging companies and other industries. Forest \nelephants were often killed when they approached \nvillages, and therefore they largely ranged far away \nfrom villages in remote and inaccessible forests."}

Furthermore, \nelephants that have witnessed the killing of their \nconspecifics and have grown up without larger tuskers \nmight lose fear and show increased aggression.

However, it is important \nto understand that forest elephants have extremely \nslow population growth rates (Turkalo et al., 2017), \nand the apparent increase in conflict is thus not due \nto a sudden increase in the local forest elephant \npopulations.

{"text":"181\n2. Types of human-elephant \nconflict and impact on livelihoods\nElephants and people compete for space, water and \nfood. Rural human population growth results in an \nexpansion of agricultural land and a reduction of forest \nelephant habitat. Due to their large body size, enormous \nnutritional needs (up to 450\u2009kg of food per day), and \nwide-ranging behavior, forest elephants regularly come \ninto conflict with humans (Fritz, 2017). Elephants are \nparticularly notorious crop raiders, and their ability \nto destroy an entire year\u2019s worth of crops in a single \nvisit can threaten a\u00ad\n \u00ad\nfarmer\u2019s livelihood. Elephants are \nmessy eaters and can easily destroy around one hectare \nof crops in a few raids. When we address conflict due \nto forest elephants, it is therefore important to know \nthat a single elephant can cause huge damage. Thus, it \nis not surprising that forest elephants are considered \namong the top-ranking crop-raiding species, which \nlikely leads to declining tolerance for elephants in rural \n\u00ad\ncommunities (Naughton-Treves & Treves, 2005).\nIn addition to damaging crops, they destroy food \nstores and water sources, and sometimes threaten \nhuman life. Impacts can be either direct (crop loss, \nproperty destruction, injury, etc.) or more hidden, such \nas the opportunity costs of added expenditures and \nworkload (Hoare, 2000a; Hill, 2004; Jadhav & Barua, \n2012; Walker, 2012; Barua et al., 2013; Gladman et al., \n2020; Salerno et al., 2020).\nAnother way to categorize these costs is to split \nthem into tangible and intangible categories (Kansky \n& Knight, 2014). Tangible costs are financial losses \nsuch as infrastructure and harvests damages, whereas \nintangible costs are non-monetary, temporally \ndelayed, and often psychological in nature (fear, stress, \nsleep-\u00ad\ndeprivation or in the extreme case grief over a \ndeath)."}

To be successful, a human-elephant conflict \nprogram must consider both monetary and intangible \ncosts as they are likely to have different types of influ-\nence on peoples\u2019 perceptions and levels of tolerance \nfor co-\u00ad\nexistence. Here we briefly describe some of \nthe major impacts that forest elephants can have on \npeople and their livelihoods.\n2.1 Crop raiding\nCrop raiding is often mentioned as being \nrespon\u00ad\nsible for the largest (monetary) impact of \nhuman-wildlife conflict on human livelihoods \n(Naughton et al., 1999; Mackenzie & Ahabyona, \n2012; Hill, 2018). In Central Africa, it predomi-\nnantly impacts individually managed smallholder \nfarms using slash-and-burn practices (Lahm, 1996; \nMadzou, 1999; Naughton et al., 1999; Boukoulou \net al., 2012a; Eyebe et al., 2012; Fairet, 2012; Walker, \n2012; \u00ad\nInogwabini et al., 2014; Nsonsi et al., 2017). \nCrop raiding is likely to have occurred ever since \nthe existence of \u00ad\nagriculture in Africa. Most people"}
{"text":"182\nin Central Africa practice smallholder agricul-\nture and shifting cultivation (land is cultivated for \naround two years and then allowed to lie fallow for \n5-20 years), primarily of root crops such as cassava, \nyams and cocoyam, banana\/plantain trees, and occa-\nsional ground nuts. Farming is typically practiced \nusing slash-and-burn practices on private family \nplots managed by native smallholders. Cultivation \nin re-growing secondary forests of umbrella trees \n(Musanga cecropiodes) is often preferred because these \nare easier to clear than old and mature forest.\nCrop raiding decreases agricultural productivity, \ncan lead to the abandonment of fields, and hinders \nefforts to reduce poverty as rural incomes often depend \non small-scale farming and are rarely compensated \n(Mackenzie & Ahabyona, 2012; Walker, 2012; Hill, \n2018). Farmers whose entire livelihoods depend on \nagriculture are often the most vulnerable. Causing on \naverage a crop loss of over 25%, crop raiding can have \nsevere consequences on both family food supplies \nand household income (Fairet, 2012; Walker, 2010, \n2012). Few people have the financial means to ensure \nfield protection. The need to protect fields overnight \nexposes guards to mosquito-borne disease, stress, \nand lack of sleep. Thus, crop raiding can have many \nnegative side-effects and increase vulnerability (e.g., \nlack of funds for mitigation measures). The extent of \nthe crop loss is therefore likely to influence people\u2019s \nperception of forest elephants. \n2.2 Infrastructure destruction\nElephants also occasionally destroy infrastructure. \nDestruction of property occurs when elephants break \ninto houses while looking for salt, soap, bread or even \ntoilet paper. Forest elephants even destroy small-scale \nalcohol breweries or accidentally fishing nets and \ndugout canoes (Nsonsi et al., 2018). \nForest elephants destroy not only the property of \nlocal communities but also tourism and research camp \ninfrastructure."}

At Mbeli Bai, in the Nouabale-Ndoki \nNational Park, one single large musth bull terrorized \nresearchers and regularly destroyed boardwalks over \nthe swamp and the tourism facilities. The same bull \ndestroyed the tourism dining room multiple times, \nand even removed mattresses from tourism bunga-\nlows which did stand on four high concrete posts. \nYears later, another younger bull regularly entered the \nsame camp and due to his aggressive behavior, the \ntourism activities had to be closed. Similar problems \noccur at other research and tourism camps.\n2.3 Competition for natural resources, \naccess restriction, injury and killing \nof\u00a0people\nForest elephants compete for wild foods such as \nwild mangos (Irvingia spp.), and many other fleshy \nfruits such as bambu (Chrysophyllum lacourtianum)"}
{"text":"183\nand moabi (Baillonella toxisperma) that have an \nimportant value for local livelihoods and on local \nand regional markets. Most of these larger trees are \nconnected via elephant paths. Elephants harvest these \nfruits from the ground or bump their heads against \nthe tree trunks with force (Maisels et al., 2002). \nForest elephants therefore directly compete with local \n\u00ad\ngatherers for these fruits and also come into contact \nwith people when looking for trees growing naturally \nin the vicinity of \u00ad\nsettlements, such as palm trees.\nForest elephants are dangerous to people. Aggres-\nsive encounters with elephants in the dense rain \nforest are common. Physical aggression and charges \nare not uncommon. Biomonitoring and ranger teams \nare regularly charged by forest elephants, and several \npeople have been wounded or killed. Thus, walking in \na forest elephant habitat is becoming more and more \ndangerous, making it necessary to be prepared for \npotential aggressive encounters. Heightened aggression \nboth in the short and long term is likely to be a conse-\nquence of poaching (Breuer et al., 2016). For example, \nwe witnessed an elephant bull that had been extremely \npeaceful and regularly frequented the park headquar-\nters become very aggressive after a poaching event in \na nearby forest clearing. Researchers and \u00ad\ntourists have \nbeen killed by hyper aggressive male elephants and \nelephant mothers protecting their young offspring.\nForest elephants can also be dangerous to people \nwhen approaching settlements.

This can substantially \ncompromise conservation efforts.

Conflict events may thus affect people for \nyears after they occur. We will see below that such \nintangible costs strongly influence tolerance for \nco-existing with wildlife.\n2.5 Price increase and standard of\u00a0living\nCrop raiding can also have secondary impacts on \npeople not involved in the farming sector as prices \nof cash crops can be higher in remote villages where \nlocal production cannot meet demand for staple foods \n(Fairet, 2012; Walker, 2012).

They range from activities that aim to \nprevent human-wildlife conflict before it occurs to \nmitigation measures that aim to reduce the impacts \nof human-wildlife conflict after it occurs (Nelson \net al., 2003; Redpath et al., 2013; Nyhus, 2016; Young \net al., 2016a; K\u00f6nig et al., 2020). Thus, in the case of \nelephants, it is not only crucial that we fully under-\nstand the ecology of forest elephant behavior to \nmodify their behavior (Mumby & Plotnik, 2018), \nwe also need to acquire a clear understanding of the \nhuman dimension of the conflict (Dickman, 2010; \nBennett et al., 2017a; Hill, 2017; Wallace & Hill, \n2017; Gross, 2019; Shaffer et al., 2019)."}

Most \nmeasures addressing human-elephant conflict have \nbeen applied in isolation, and holistic approaches are \nrare because they are not often included in the design \nof programs and\/or there is a lack of funding. To our \nknowledge, the specific problem of crop raiding has \nnever been addressed in full, even where conservation \nprojects in the Central Africa have been running for \nseveral decades. Where human-elephant activities \noccur, conservationists often only aim to mitigate \nthe visible impact of wildlife without considering the \nhuman dimension of the conflict. It is important to \nunderstand that a combination (and ideally the full \nrange) of interventions needs to be deployed \u2013 there \nis no one-size-fits-all solution.\nImplementing technical solutions that focus on \nphysical and spatial measures (e.g., beehive fencing) \nin isolation and economic fixes (e.g., compensa-\ntions) only address parts of the overall problem (see \nFigure\u202f1). More importantly, the deeper-rooted reason \nfor the conflict is not solved. Holistic landscape-based \napproaches aim to increase the willingness of local \ncommunities to tolerate and co-exist with wildlife \nconflict.

Given the \nwide-ranging nature of elephants, it will be impor-\ntant to collaborate with other stakeholders (logging \nand safari companies, and mining extractives) in \nthe buffer zones of protected areas.

{"text":"185\ninvestigate conflicts between people, even though the \nconflict with wildlife might often be a surrogate for a \n\u00ad\ndeeper-rooted social conflict.\nProblems can be very site specific and depend on \nthe socio-cultural context of the stakeholders as well \nas the ecological setting in the landscapes or around \nthe concerned protected area. Furthermore, it is \nimportant to understand whether the human-ele-\nphant conflict concerns a larger portion of the human \nand elephant populations or just a few problem \nelephants or concerned farmers. Thus, understanding \nsusceptibility to and determinants of human-\u00ad\nelephant conflict requires a deeper \u00ad\nknowledge of \nsite-specific conflict patterns, especially crop raiding, \nwhich is likely to change over time as elephants \nquickly adapt to new situations. There are various \ndimensions of vulnerability, including biophysical, \nsocial and institutional components, and investi-\ngating these components together is likely to reveal \na much better understanding than \u00ad\ninvestigating a \nsingle factor on its own.\nIt is important to know that forest elephants have \nalways been present in these landscapes. They have \nnot been re-introduced, nor have they been forced \nout of protected areas due to growth in the elephant \npopulation. It is a misconception that more signs of \nhuman-elephant conflict are due to an increasing \nforest elephant population resulting from successful \nlaw enforcement activities as forest elephants show \nslow population recovery (Turkalo et al., 2017). \nConflict between elephants and people arises due to \nthe expansion of human settlements and slash-and-\nburn agriculturel, which are encroaching on elephant \nhabitats, and to elephants moving to areas where \nthey feel safe.

For example, conflicts are exacerbated due to the \nphenomenon of compression into protected areas and \nthe loss of fear of humans due to local high levels of \nprotection, and the attraction of elephants to secondary \nforest with its dense understory (Nchanji & Lawson, \n1998; Naughton et al., 1999; \u00ad\nNaughton-Treves & \nTreves, 2005; Breuer et al., 2016). Given the anthro-\npogenic impacts on forest elephants, the killing of \nlarger older tuskers with the resulting loss of ecolog-\nical knowledge, heightened aggression and increased \nexploratory behavior of younger males combined with \nincreased compression and fragmentation, it is very \nlikely that human-elephant conflict is going to severely \nincrease in the future, despite an overall decline \nin forest elephant numbers (Breuer\u00a0et al.,\u00a02016). \nThis\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0\u00ad\nexaggerated by the deteriorating social \ncontext (e.g., increased poverty, civil and political \ninstability, worsened governmental support, rapid \npopulation growth and land needs, but also rural \nexodus, etc.) in some Central African countries (e.g., \nsocial vulnerability). If local people feel that they are \nleft alone to face these problems, a transformation \nfrom conflict to co-existence is unlikely to happen."}
{"text":"186\n3.2 Perceptions and root causes \naffecting tolerance of co-existence \nwith\u00a0forest elephants\nConservation programs aiming to mitigate the \nimpacts of human-wildlife conflict must under-\nstand the social dimensions of the conflict because \nhuman-wildlife conflict is often mainly about social \nconflicts between different human groups (Hill, 2004; \nDickman, 2010; Hill, 2017; Wallace & Hill, 2017; \nVucetich et al., 2018). Negative impacts on livelihoods \n(and tangible costs) often are far less of a problem \nthan the pervasive existence of negative perceptions \namong stakeholders (Hill, 2004; Webber et al., 2007). \nSuch data should take into account that the percep-\ntion of conflict wildlife can differ between households \nand according to a variety of socio-economic factors \nsuch as gender, level of education, ethnicity, residency, \ndependency on farming and wealth (Naughton et al., \n1999; Hill, 2004; Naughton-Treves & Treves, 2005; \nKansky & Knight, 2014; Nsonsi et al., 2017, 2018).\n3.2.1 Addressing lack of knowledge and \nconsidering local attitudes\nFirst, it is important to understand that local people, \nand occasionally even members of wildlife authori-\nties in Central Africa, have limited knowledge about \nthe management of human-wildlife conflicts. State-\nments such as the \u201cwildlife that come from the nearby \nprotected area\u201d often are incorrect because wildlife are \nnot confined (in most cases) to protected areas and \noften have been living in the landscapes long before the \nestablishment of human settlements and agriculture. \nNext, the size and behavior of the crop-raiding \nspecies strongly influences perceptions; for example, \nattitudes towards elephants are often based on \nextreme damage events which contrast with the small \npersistent damage caused by smaller animals such as \nrodents or insects (Hill, 2004; Naughton-Treves & \nTreves, 2005; Oerke, 2006; Arlet & Molleman, 2007)."}

When conservationists and people in the \nWestern world argue about the importance of forest \nelephants, they use terminology such as forest engi-\nneers, ecosystem services, and seed dispersers (Blake \net al., 2009; Poulsen et al., 2018). They regard wildlife \nwith affection and admiration and highlight their role \nas tourism magnets. Local people often do not under-\nstand the link between wildlife \u00ad\npresence and ecological \nservices as these concepts are complex. For example, it \nwas recently demonstrated that elephants have a posi-\ntive effect on soil fertility with important implications \nfor local agricultural \u00ad\npractices (Sitters\u00a0et al., 2020). \nOn the other hand, local people see wildlife quite \ndifferently and judge them as dangerous and pests \nthat damage their property (Hill, 1998). For example, \nin Northern Congo, negative attitudes towards forest \nelephants were largely associated with farming activity, \nlack of benefits from the conservation project and past \nconflicts with wildlife law enforcement (Nsonsi et al., \n2017, 2018).

{"text":"187\nwhere positive benefits of wildlife exist, inter\u00ad\nactions \nwith wildlife are framed negatively. Complaints \nexpressed by local farmers can make human-elephant \nconflict a highly political issue between protected area \nmanagers and local communities. This is intensified \ndue to a widespread lack of understanding about the \nrole of each conservation actor.\nUnderstanding perceptions of wildlife and the \nprevalent conservation conflict matters and needs to \ninform wildlife tolerance and co-existence strategies \nand the implementation of management responses \n(Nsonsi et al., 2017, 2018; Vasudev et al., 2020). When \naddressing human-wildlife conflict, it is therefore \nimportant to understand who the different stake-\nholders are, what their interests are, and what types of \nconflict exist between them.\n3.2.2 Lack of participation and ownership \nof wildlife and protected areas\nPerceptions might also reflect underlying issues of \nwildlife ownership, differences in benefit sharing and \nstakeholder involvement as well as power differentials \nbetween different human groups (institutional vulnera-\nbility). Overall, protected area management in Central \nAfrica reflects a top-down conservation strategy in \nwhich locals are mostly excluded from decision making. \nHowever, authorities in charge of managing protected \nareas in Central Africa have limited technical skills \nand financial means. International Non Governmental \nOrganizations (NGOs, including foreign staff) there-\nfore often take over much of the daily work on the \nground in collaboration with the government.

Perceptions can reflect past \nconflictual events and not necessarily current conflict. \nNegative perceptions towards wildlife can result from \npast confrontations with wildlife laws (e.g., with \nrangers) and consequently some wildlife species, in \nparticular forest elephants, are perceived as the main \nconflict species (Fairet, 2012; Nsonsi et al., 2018). \nSometimes local people, including farmers, even \nthreaten conservationists and park managers because \nwildlife destroyed their properties, including fields. \nFor instance, if an elephant kills a farmer near a \nprotected area, this may result in a massive protest \nagainst the protected area\u2019s administration, some-\ntime resulting in the burning of staff offices and \ncars. Clearly, such deep-rooted attitudes and polit-\nical manipulation have often been ignored in local \nconservation projects. Indeed, intangible costs have \nbeen identified as having a much larger impact on \ntolerance of living with wildlife like elephants and \nbuffaloes than the perceived monetary costs or lack of \nbenefits from their conservation."}

{"text":"189\n3.2.4 Other social and cultural conflicts\nThere are also conflicts between farmers. For \ninstance, some farmers accuse their neighbors of \nwitchcraft and of transforming themselves into \nelephants to destroy their plantations because, by \nchance, an elephant feeds in one field and leaves the \nneighboring fields untouched (Nsonsi, n.d.). The \nowner of the destroyed field takes a negative view of \nthe luckier ones. \nPerceptions are likely to differ due to people\u2019s \nethnic and residency background (Parathian et al., \n2018). Clearly pygmies, who have a strong spiritual \nlink to elephants, have different attitudes than \nBantus (K\u00f6hler, 2005). Many Bantu tribes believe \nthat elephants are totems of the Aka\/Baka pygmies \nwho want to punish them by annihilating their \nefforts in the agricultural sector.

Among the \npreferred crops are maize, bananas and cassava, but \nalso sugarcane, sweet potatoes and rice. Crops may \nalso provide additional benefits to wildlife, such as the \nprovision of rare nutrients. \nThe location, size and vegetation around a field \n(see fruiting trees above) are also important \u00ad\npredictors"}
{"text":"190\nof elephant crop raids. In Central Africa, it appears \nthat the scattered pattern of planting due to low \nquality soil, far away from the village, also creates \nmore opportunities for crop-raiding by wildlife. If \nfarmers open their fields in a nearby elephant habitat, \nthese fields will be more vulnerable.\nIt therefore is important to understand how \nelephants move through the forest and which factors \ninfluence their distribution and abundance in the \nabsence of anthropogenic activities (e.g., habitat \ntypes, understory composition and canopy closure, \nproximity to natural forest clearings or other salt licks, \nseasonal concentration of fruiting trees; existence \nof elephant paths; Ngama et al., 2019; Beirne et al., \n2020). In a recent study in Gabon, researchers found \nthat the presence of wild fruiting trees near farms \nincreased the occurrence of crop damage, particularly \nwhen those trees were bearing ripe fruits (Ngama \net al., 2019).\nFields are also more difficult to guard if they are \nfar from a village. For instance, elephants largely raid \ncrops during the night or when people are absent. \nSmaller fields are often more vulnerable than larger \nones. The general lack of organized, team-based \n\u00ad\nmitigation strategies exacerbates the situation.\nPatterns found in savanna elephants (e.g., rain-\nfall) are likely not to be the same for forest elephants \nbecause water is overall abundant with some notably \nseasonal exceptions (Blake, 2002). Nevertheless, \npeaks in crops raiding occur more often in the wet \nseason at some sites when forage quality is low and \nwhen elephants appear to be ranging closer to culti-\nvated areas, although other studies could not find any \nseasonal difference. However, traditional farming is \ndetermined by the rainfall season. Researchers also \nfound higher susceptibility to crop raiding when \nfields were located near permanent water points \nat some sites, but not at other ones. Interestingly, \nelephants do not raid crops grown on steeply sloping \nfields, thus providing further conflict mitigation \noptions (Ngama et al., 2019)."}

We briefly present a few important \u00ad\nmonitoring \nquestions and tools.\nMonitoring must take place at different levels \nwith baselines and follow-up monitoring of project \nsuccess of prevention and mitigation strategies (Pozo \net al., 2017). Various questions about human-elephant \nconflict need to be answered, most notably: reports \nby farmers themselves have been shown to over\u00ad\nestimate the real impact of damage by crop-raiding \nspecies; so what is the exact amount of crop-raiding \nby forest elephants and how does it compare to less \nvisible species (such as rodents)? How effective are \nmitigation methods in reducing tangible costs? How \ncan we measure and monitor intangible costs to better \naddress them? How does crop-raiding and trampling \ndamage impact the harvest in palm oil or agroforestry \nplantations (e.g., African oil palm, safou (Dacryodes \nedulis), kola nut (Cola spp.), etc.)?\nStandardized data collection protocols have been \ndeveloped for savanna elephants that have been used \nto quantify the impact of crop raiding (Hoare, 1999, \n2000b; Parker et al., 2007). However, it has been \nextremely challenging to confirm whether reported \n(or perceived) impacts reflect real impacts because of \nthe time required for wildlife managers to confirm \nraids. Therefore, more participative and real-time \ndocumentation has been recommended.

Ngama, IRAF-CENAREST\nContext\nThe use of beehives to protect plantations has successfully reduced elephant damage on crops \nin many savanna areas throughout Africa (King et al., 2009, 2011, 2017; Goodier & King, 2017; \nBranco et al., 2019; Scheijen et al., 2019). Beekeeping has the additional advantage of producing \nhoney, potentially diversifying and increasing the livelihoods of local farmers. While promising, \nthis method needs further research because no comparable work has been conducted on forest \nelephants or with Apis mellifera adansonii, the only species of African honey bee in Central \nAfrica. The trials presented here had two objectives: (1) experimentally examining whether the \npresence of the African honey bee species present in Central Africa deters forest elephants \nfrom feeding on fruit trees; (2) assessing whether local communities could adopt the strategy \non using beehives to both protect their crops and enhance their livelihoods (Ngama et al., 2016).\nMethods and results\nWe conducted trials with local people to adopt modern beekeeping around Monts de \nCristal National Park and in the Gamba Complex. Ten villages were involved, and residents \nwere sensitized on the importance of bees and modern beekeeping. Technical, financial and \nhuman limitations were considered by setting trials according to available resources.

However, it should be clear \nthat, most often, fencing only solves human-wildlife \nconflict locally as it shifts problems elsewhere.\nMost successful crop harvests throughout the \nregion are performed by local farmers implementing \na mix of locally based methods and actively guarding \ntheir fields.

{"text":"203\nInsurance system for crop damage caused by animals \n in Odzala-Kokoua National Park\nA. Ed\u00e9, APN\nAssessment of the problem and the solution tested\nIn the Republic of the Congo, the State is supposed to pay compensation for damage caused \nby protected wildlife (Decree No. 06\/970 of 1986). However, this system is not working in the \nfield. Faced with the distress of rural communities, the managers of Odzala-Kokoua National \nPark decided to set up an insurance scheme to help the people who were most affected \nand depended on their fields for their livelihoods. This system was not, however, intended to \nreplace the role of the State, which remains responsible for crop compensation payments.\nAn insurance fund was created with the support of partners such as the European Union, and \nthanks to members who pay a membership fee of 2,500 FCFA\/ha\/year (about US$4\/ha\/year) \nto insure their fields. When there is damage, policyholders notify park managers, who come \nto draw up a damage report. Compensation is calculated proportionally in relation to several \nparameters: the damage (based on Decree 06\/970), the state of the fields, and the farmer\u2019s \nmonitoring efforts. Policyholders are then compensated twice a year.\nFollowing difficulties encountered during the first four years of operation, a new insurance \nprogram was set up. It is no longer based on Decree 06\/970, which had a compensation scale \nthat was outdated and unsuitable, and it defines more appropriate and simplified compen-\nsation rules. The maximum payment (200,000 FCFA\/ha) is reached when the sum of the \ndevastated areas is equal to or surpasses 25% of the field size; below that, the policyholder is \ncompensated according to the severity of the damage, up to a maximum of 100,000 FCFA\/ha.\nResults and lessons learned\nThis insurance scheme provides monetary compensation for damage while seeking to \nencourage the most appropriate behavior.

It is no longer based on Decree 06\/970, which had a compensation scale \nthat was outdated and unsuitable, and it defines more appropriate and simplified compen-\nsation rules. The maximum payment (200,000 FCFA\/ha) is reached when the sum of the \ndevastated areas is equal to or surpasses 25% of the field size; below that, the policyholder is \ncompensated according to the severity of the damage, up to a maximum of 100,000 FCFA\/ha.\nResults and lessons learned\nThis insurance scheme provides monetary compensation for damage while seeking to \nencourage the most appropriate behavior. However, it faces many problems. First, it is not \nfinancially self-sufficient. Second, to register the reports, significant human resources and \nmeans of transportation are required. This insurance system also can have perverse effects \nand encourage communities to not protect their fields. Furthermore, communities do not \n\u00ad\nnecessarily understand the complicated insurance process, particularly the calculation of \npayments. This renders the process opaque and raises the possibility of corruption, misuse \nof funds and tribalism, and policyholders sometimes accuse the management team of being \ninvolved in such practices. Lastly, the reaction of communities may not be commensurate \nwith the actual damage, and some villages may complain that they have not been sufficiently \ncompensated compared to other villages. \nTo overcome these problems, the following is needed: 1) effective awareness-raising about \nhow the insurance system works with the support of government officials; 2) a capacity to \nrapidly record damage reports; 3) the use of a standard damage assessment method that has \nbeen approved by members; 4) the use of a simple compensation system that is understood \nby the majority of members and which they can follow up with receipts of damage reports \nprovided by the management team; and 5) the system must encourage practices to resolve \nhuman-wildlife conflict and be able to guarantee the amount of compensation. Without all \nof these parameters, it is highly likely that the insurance system will have a negative impact \non human-wildlife relations around protected areas."}

{"text":"204\nCompensations are difficult to manage, particu-\nlarly over large landscapes, since it is often impossible \nto attribute a loss (e.g., crop raiding) to a specific \nspecies. Often wildlife and\/or agriculture authorities \nare not reliable and come late when signs of damage \nare no longer visible. Obviously, they are open to \nconsiderable abuse and fraudulent claims or blatant \ncorruption. Illiterate farmers have difficulties submit-\nting claims. Some studies point out that representatives \nfrom the agricultural ministry are notoriously absent \nin the field, do not use accurate assessment methods \nand that claims are not processed for years and most \nof them are not paid. When they are paid out to \nsome (not all), this might cause \u00ad\nresentment or social \n\u00ad\nproblems among recipients.\nSince they do not tackle the underlying causes of \nhuman-wildlife conflict, compensations can result \nin sloppy livestock and crop protection practices \nand do not promote co-existence. Some authors \neven argue that at worst compensations exacerbate \nhuman-wildlife conflicts. In the worst case, compen-\nsations might have the unintended consequence of \nsubsidizing agricultural expansion and might increase \nthe conflict between people when only a few, and not \nall people, receive compensations. Finally, compensa-\ntion and efforts to address tangible costs might have \nlittle impact on farmers\u2019 tolerance to co-exist with \nelephants, particularly when intangible costs \u00ad\ninfluence \ntolerance levels more than tangible costs.\nTo overcome these challenges, various locally \nmanaged insurance schemes have emerged (Morrison \net al., 2009; Chen et al., 2013; Wilson-Holt & Steele, \n2019). To improve the effectiveness of compensation \nschemes, clear guidelines must be elaborated that \naddress the conditions of payments. The administra-\ntive burden should be kept to a minimum to allow \nquick payments, and the system should be flexible to \ninclude new rules. A monitoring scheme must be in \nplace that allows time effective validation of claims. \nPayments should reflect levels of losses and should be \nmade within a short timeframe after verification of \nthe damage\/loss."}

Co-existence can be defined as \u201ca dynamic \nbut sustainable state in which humans and wildlife \nco-adapt to live in shared landscapes governed by \neffective institutions that ensure long-term wild-\nlife population persistence, social legitimacy, and"}

The \nparticipation and engagement of local communities \nis crucial for any human-wildlife conflict approach \nand the success of such a transformation process \n(Madden, 2004; Treves et al., 2006, 2009).\nTolerance in the context of human-wildlife conflict \ncan be defined as the ability of an individual to absorb \nthe potential or actual costs of living with wildlife. \nTo increase tolerance, we first need a complete under-\nstanding of the factors impacting tolerance. Recent \nresearch findings are demonstrating that tangible \n(monetary) costs have little impact on people\u2019s atti-\ntudes. Intangible costs, on the other hand, seem to \nbe driving tolerance for co-existence with wildlife \n(Saif\u00a0et al., 2020).\nVarious activities can help to increase local toler-\nance, ranging from knowledge increase, reducing \nintangible costs, and increasing intangible bene-\nfits. Essentially, awareness raising should aim to \nrevert hostility and increase levels of tolerance and \npro-conservation behavior (Espinosa & Jacobson, \n2012). Where forest elephants occur, it is important \nto provide knowledge on their natural behavior and \ntheir historic distribution.

Engagement is only possible when \nlocal communities take ownership of the project and \nhelp to develop and decide relevant interventions.\nIdeally, locally led conflict resolution commit-\ntees made up of local stakeholders should be created \ninstead of inactive national wildlife and protected \narea authorities. Such committees can help to share \nknowledge, identify strategies to change perceptions, \nand principally help to manage natural resources in a \nsustainable way by pooling their resources. Potential \nsolutions can be based on existing positive inter\u00ad\nactions \nwith and attitudes towards elephants. Similarly, when \ncompensations or insurance systems are based on local \nownership and local financial contributions, there is a \nmuch better chance that they will be accepted among \nthe local stakeholders.\n3.12 Integrated landscape management\nHuman-wildlife conflict must be addressed at \nvarious spatial scales. Land-use planning helps to \naddress the causes of the conflict and goes beyond \ntreatment of the symptoms (mitigation strategies, \ncompensations, etc.). A landscape-based approach \n(some of them transboundary) has been promoted \nin Central Africa where people and wildlife share \nresources (Angu et al., 2011). Integrating human-wild-\nlife conflict programs into such an approach is \nconsidered as one of the greatest long-term activities \nto increase human-elephant co-existence (Osborn & \nParker, 2003; Dublin & Hoare, 2004; Walker, 2010; \nFairet, 2012).

Identification and \ncreation of wildlife corridors between high density \nzones, such as protected areas or high conservation \nvalue forest within logging concessions, is of crucial \nimportance in this land-use exercise. This planning \nconcerns elephants that move out of isolated protected \nareas and come into conflict with riverine commu-\nnities and farms in the vicinity of the protected area \nborder. In that case, land-use planning including wide \nbuffer zones (e.g., planted with unpalatable crops \nsuch as medical herbs or chili) can be an option. For \nexample, a buffer zone with forest plantations (euca-\nlyptus and acacia) and tea plantations has been set up \naround Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda."}
{"text":"207\nTaking into consideration elephant needs within \na landscape is much more challenging as we have \nlittle understanding about their seasonal movements. \nDetailed knowledge on wildlife behavior (where avail-\nable) needs to be included in such planning and zoning \nexercises as in the case of savanna elephants (Graham \net al., 2009; Granados et al., 2012; Bastille-Rousseau \net al., 2020; Snyder et al., 2020). For example, we must \nconsider the wide-ranging nature of forest elephants \nand particularly the explorative behavior of younger \nmale elephants.\nSettlements and farms should not be created along \nknown elephant paths, close to natural forest clearings \n(bais) and salt licks and should not disturb migration \ncorridors to seasonal available fruiting trees. Any \nplanning should model how potential habitat changes \nand losses of high conservation value forest impact \nforest elephant distribution.\nThe success of any planning exercise will be based \non a government\u2019s commitment. Too often, we have \nseen that existing land-use plans are not respected and \nare not included in legislation and policy. Despite the \nexistence of inter-ministerial exchange committees, the \ndifferent ministries often do not consult each other, \nresulting in land use overlaps; mining concessions are \noverlapping with protected areas and\/or large oil palm or \ntimber concessions are attributed without consultation \nof relevant stakeholders (Javelle, 2012; Schwartz et al., \n2012). Improvement of the legal framework related to \nland-use planning and reforms is currently taking place \nin some and is starting in other Central Africa coun-\ntries.

These\u00a0include the national parks of Bouba-Ndjida, Benoue and Faro \nin\u00a0Cameroon, the complexes of protected areas in the northeast and the Chinko \nregion of the Central African Republic (CAR), and Garamba National Park and \nBili\u2011Uere Hunting Estate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nWhile transhumant pastoralism has been practiced \nfor many years in these areas, the expanded network \nand strengthened management measures of protected \nareas \u2013 known as \u201cpaper parks\u201d  \u2013 have focused atten-\ntion on the question of the coexistence of protected \nareas and transhumance. \nIn 2019, the N\u2019Djamena conference made it \npossible to include this topic in the policy agenda \nof Central African regional institutions. However, \nthe linking of transhumance, poaching, illegal traf-\nficking and the movement of armed groups steered \ndiscussions towards a security approach to trans\u00ad\nhumance. Conservation officers of protected areas \ncannot effectively manage such an approach alone as \nthey have neither the means nor a mandate to deal \nwith security issues. \nThis chapter attempts to explore the interface \nbetween protected areas and transhumance, a form \nof pastoralism. It highlights the broad elements \nneeded for understanding this issue while empha-\nsizing the fact that the way it is expressed varies \ndepending on the specific characteristics of each site \nand protected area.\nPastoralism contributes significantly to the Gross \nDomestic Product (GDP) of Central African states. \nIt is a complex production system characterized by \nmobility that can take many forms depending on the \nenvironment. It is currently subject to heavy pres-\nsures, both short-term and structural, and the way \nthat pastoralism evolves will dramatically change the \nmanagement of protected areas in the long run."}

Although the reli-\nability of data related to this sector is debatable, the \nstudies available indicate a strong growth in livestock \nsince the 1990s (Figure\u202f2). \nIn Chad, according to the 2017-2021 National \nLivestock Development Plan, this sector accounts \nfor between 30 to 50% of the country\u2019s exports \n(excluding oil). Annual income flows are estimated \nto be around 140\u202fbillion FCFA and the added value \nat 210\u202fbillion\u00a0 FCFA.

These movements are usually \npredictable because pastoralists and their herds \ngenerally follow the same paths in the same season \neach year to reach pastures which are known to them. \nDepending on the case, these movements may be \neither pendular (moving from one point to another \nwith a return by the same path) or circular (following \na loop bringing them back to their starting point), \nbut are rarely random (OCDE, 2014). Several factors \ncontribute to determining the movements: envi-\nronmental conditions of the areas travelled across, \naccessibility of resources, herd composition and type \nof animals (dromedaries, cattle, goats, mixed), pres-\nence of markets, existence of borders along the path, \nsecurity climate, system of alliance and social agree-\nments, etc. These are all elements that, combined \ntogether, precisely \u00ad\ndetermine the direction of the \nmovements.\nThe composition of the herd is the primary factor \ndictating the type of transhumance. Depending on the \ntype of animal (cattle, goats or dromedaries), pastora-\nlists must calculate the distance to cover between \ntwo water points. Cattle and small ruminants rarely \nmove more than 30\u2009km per day.

Consequently, any \nattempt to classify pastoralism is inevitably simplistic. \nNonetheless, four major types of pastoralism can be \ndistinguished: \n\u2022\t Nomadism, which describes a mode of operating \nwith the continuous, unpredictable movement of \nall members of a family or a group. Certain Peul \ngroups may be viewed as practicing nomadism. They \nbegan their movements from the Cameroon border \nstarting in the 1920s, and from western Chad in the \n1990s. Since then, their migrations have led them \ninto eastern CAR and northeastern DRC. \n\u2022\t Long-distance transhumance, which favors long \njourneys to and from a destination.

They prefer to move in stages from \npond to pond, rapidly descending south en masse, \navoiding the risk of floods or, to the contrary, ponds \ndrying out early. At the end of the dry season, the \nanimals return north to their home territories. \nThese seasonal transhumance journeys can cover \ndistances of up to 1,500\u2009km. \n\u2022\t Medium-distance transhumance involves shorter \nmovements, on territories circumscribed by \nwatering points or campsites where the pastora\u00ad\nlists\u2019 families live on a permanent basis.

These \nwill continue to have a long-term impact on transhu-\nmance.

They explain in part the problems encountered \nin the management of protected areas. \n1.3.1 Climate uncertainty\nSince the 1970s, the Lake Chad basin has been \nexperiencing a drought marked by reduced rainfall, \na southward shift in isohyetes of about 200\u2009km and \nincreased temperatures (UICN & CBLT, 2007). Since \nthe 1990s, there has been an overall trend towards \nresumed rainfall in the Sudano-Sahelian zone.

Furthermore, intermittent droughts have been \noccurring more frequently in recent years."}

Furthermore, intermittent droughts have been \noccurring more frequently in recent years.\nUnder these uncertain climate conditions, pastora-\nlists are extending, reducing and modifying their \nroutes. Over the past 20 years, Chadian long-distance \ntranshumance pastoralists have been venturing ever \nfurther south in search of pastures that remain viable \nlate in the season (Figure\u202f4). This phenomenon is not \nonly due to climate uncertainty. It also is due to an \noverall increase in herd sizes, which is driving the \nsearch for new pasture land. Climate uncertainty thus \nmust be considered alongside other factors, such as \nimproved animal and human health (lower mortality \nrate for those under 15 years, more adults, thus the \nneed for more animals).  \nWhile many pastoralists return to their home \nterritories at the season\u2019s end, some groups also set up \nsemi-permanent camps on the new pastureland and \nleave a few family members there. The latter wind up \nsettling down and engaging in small-scale farming. \nThey then organize the movements of their animals \nover shorter distances around these new anchor points. \nThe combination of livestock and crop production is a \ncommon diversification and risk-mitigation strategy \nrelated to climate hazards. It also is a strategy imple-\nmented by crop farmers who invest in livestock and \nwhose animals are added to those of the transhumant \npastoralists during the dry season."}

{"text":"A map of transhumance routes redrawn by insecurity\nInsecurity is increasingly manifest along all of the transhumance routes of the Sudanian region \nin Central Africa, and is without doubt the main contributor to the recent redrawing of the \ngeneral map of transhumance. Three major crises have directly affected the organization of \ntranshumance in Central Africa over the last 20 years. \nIn the 2000s, the Darfur crisis forced pastoralists in eastern Chad to abandon their tradi-\ntional transhumance routes, which had become too dangerous along the border with Sudan. \nThey shifted westward onto other, lesser known transhumance corridors on which they had \nweaker social relationships with sedentary villages (Bonnet, 2013). Numerous local conflicts \nbetween pastoralists and farmers thus multiplied along the new routes lying east of Zakouma \nNational Park. \nThe crisis in CAR began in 2013. It again altered the map of transhumance routes in a broader \nmanner. Until then, a large community of Peul pastoralists had occupied western CAR. Under \npressure from Anti-Balaka militia groups, this region has been virtually emptied of cattle, with \npastoralists taking refuge in Cameroon or in eastern CAR. The latter region was under the \ncontrol of the Seleka rebels, who are friendlier to the Peul. Large herds thus arrived in south-\neastern CAR. In the northeastern part of the country along the border with Chad, tensions flared \nunder the combined effect of the northward movement of pastoralists from CAR (seeking to \nflee the political crisis in their country) and the southward descent of Chadian pastoralists \n(following poor rainfall). \nThe security crisis in northern Nigeria has led to the closure of the border with Chad. It there-\nfore affected the cross-border flows of Chadian pastoralists who had to change their routes \nto reach large Nigerian markets. They have managed by following more secure but longer \nroutes via Cameroon and particularly Niger. To cope with the security risk, some transhumant \npastoralists have been forced to settle permanently or semi-permanently south of the Logone \nplain (Cameroon)."}

Insecurity in southern \nLibya also is affecting traditional camelid trade exchanges.\n228\n1.3.2 The burden of insecurity\nDeadly cattle raids have long been carried out \nperiodically between groups of transhumant pastora-\nlists to gain access to pastures or strategic water \npoints. Conflicts with farmers are likewise recurrent. \nHowever, over the past few years, insecurity is leaving \nan increasing mark on pastoral areas in CAR, eastern \nChad, and northern Nigeria (Bonnet, 2013).\nIn fragile states, transhumant pastoralists are regu-\nlarly subject to abuse from rebel groups. This abuse \nincludes the payment of taxes, livestock theft, kidnap-\npings and ransom demands. In response, transhumant \npastoralists are tending to arm themselves to protect \ntheir livestock and their families. They sometimes \nopt to regroup their herds en masse and join forces to \nguard the animals, limit their movements on certain \nstages, or on the contrary accelerate to pass certain \nareas at risk.

Pastoralists \nare required to provide services to the rebels and thus \nsometimes become their allies against their will.\nThis militarization of transhumance reinforces \nfeelings of insecurity and instability. The recent \nspread of firearms among transhumant pastoralists is \nraising the specter of arms trafficking and the wide-"}
{"text":"229\nspread renting of arms to criminals and rebels, which \nis further increasing demand among pastoralists. \nTo avoid rebellion movements, herders are heading \ntowards remote border areas which are vast, marginal-\nized territories where there is little central government \ncontrol. In CAR, large herds are thus sometimes \nescorted by armed herders equipped with modern \ncommunication equipment. They move across areas \nconsidered to be virtual \u201cgray zones\u201d but which also \nhost certain emblematic protected areas. \n1.3.3 The impact of trade \nand\u00a0socioeconomic inequality\nAs for all of Africa, globalization has strongly \naffected pastoralist communities. As a result, pastoral \npractices, such as transhumance, have changed \nsubstantially over the last 30 years. The development \nof urban markets and access to basic services, and the \nimprovement of communication technologies, have \nopened the door to new opportunities. Since the \n1990s, the flows of cattle from Chad and northern \nCameroon to major urban markets have grown \nsteadily. Herds most often head towards Nigeria. \nThe prices of animals are generally set according \nto the terms of trade with agricultural products. \n\u00ad\nPastoralists have long benefited from relatively stable \nterms of trade favorable to their activity. Today, specu\u00ad\nlation, price volatility and the substitution of local \nproducts by imported products are causing price \ninstability. Depending on the geographic area, the \nprice relationship between livestock products and \nagricultural products has even changed to the detri-\nment of pastoralists. Pastoralists must sell more to \ngenerate the same amount of income that they earned \npreviously. For some pastoralists, the size of their \nhousehold\u2019s herd is decreasing at the very moment \nthat they should have more animals to ensure the \nsurvival of their family units in the medium term.\nIn both Chad and Cameroon, a gradual transfer of \nlivestock is taking place, from the smallest and poorest \npastoralists to the wealthiest ones. Rich transhumant \npastoralists benefit from the protection of national \neconomic and political environments thanks to their \nlucrative activities.

On the other hand, the overall herd size \nof wealthy pastoralists developing \u201centreprenurial\u201d \npastoralism is increasing exponentially, involving new \npractices that do not include the historical, cultural, \nsocial and societal features of pastoralism, and which \nare considered to be the main causes of local conflicts \nand the destruction of wildlife habitats. \n1.3.4 Pastoral areas on the fringes of \nagricultural development\nDespite considerable social, economic and polit-\nical progress, transhumant pastoralists generally are \nsubject to a certain degree of cultural and spatial \nisolation. In pastoralist regions, human development \nindicators remain poor, and the provision of public \nservices is limited. Basic services are largely inac-\ncessible for transhumant pastoralists. The remote \nconditions of pastoralist regions often justify a \nlow-level of government investment. Furthermore, \ndecision makers promoting territorial development \nprograms have long overlooked transhumant commu-\nnities. Mobility is often perceived to be an obstacle to \nthe organization of space. Pastoral systems continue \nto be described as \u201ctraditional\u201d.

{"text":"231\n1.3.5 Demographic impact\nPastoralism also is facing other challenges which \nare much more internal. One in particular is the \npopulation growth of pastoralist communities. \nSince the middle of the 20th century, the popu-\nlation in the Sahel has more than tripled. Following \na similar dynamic, the current population growth in \npastoral areas is 2.5 to 3.5% per year. The populations \nwho depend on pastoralism may thus double every 25 \nto 35 years (African Union, 2010). The impact of this \ngrowth will affect the entire Sudanian region in the \nyears to come. \nPastoral societies will be unable to absorb the \npopulation overflow in the long term. The number of \nlivestock, even if rising sharply, will not be sufficient \nto support an excessively large population. Currently, \nnumerous young people from pastoralist households \nalready must leave pastoralism to find other means of \nemancipation and subsistence. Some take up farming, \npick up a trade or join the government if they have a \nsufficient level of education. They thereby put an end \nto their mobility. They nonetheless remain culturally \nlinked to pastoralism, and still invest some of their \nincome in the purchase of livestock. They keep the \nanimals near their camps or on the outskirts of the \nurban centers where they live and work. \nThe owners in questions do not practice transhu-\nmance, but their animals join those of trans\u00ad\nhumant \npastoralists and other agropastoralists on the \npasturelands during the dry season. Once their \nherds have reached a certain size, some owners, who \nmay be businessmen or government bureaucrats, \nhire young herders to escort their animals to more \nremote pasturelands. When traveling, these young \nherders do not always respect the boundaries of \ntranshumance corridors or the management rules \ngoverned by and negotiated with local institutions \nand state authorities. These situations are often at \nthe root of major local conflicts when the animals \ndestroy farmers\u2019 fields. \nOther young pastoralists are not thriving and are \nlimiting themselves to small holdings."}

{"text":"Waza National Park (Cameroon): immense concentrations of livestock\nThe Far North region of Cameroon is a genuine crossroads of trade routes and cultures. Pasto-\nralists, their herds and wildlife have peacefully coexisted for a long time on the pastureland \nof the Waza-Logone flood plain. Each year, transhumant pastoralists move in with their herds \nfor the dry season, maintaining strong social and economic ties with local communities. Some \npastoralists gradually have established their families and part of their herds on former grazing \nareas that were attributed to them by traditional local authorities. These families started to \ngrow a few crops. The areas reserved exclusively for herds were then reduced considerably. \nAgainst this backdrop of land pressure, traditional authorities today appear to be calling into \nquestion the rules regulating access to grazing land. Pastoralists are being forced to rene-\ngotiate the sites that they sometimes have used for several generations. To avoid being \ndispossessed, land-use must be permanently visible in a landscape. Consequently, pastoralists \nwho have become agropastoralists tend to extend their cultivated areas at the expense of \npasture land, thereby affirming their rights over the land (Kossoumna Liba\u2019A, 2018). Livestock \nare then pushed back and concentrated on the few savannas remaining available. The increase \nin livestock on these areas leads to over-grazing and bush fires. Conflicts with local communi-\nties, farmers, sedentary pastoralists, transhumant pastoralists and wildlife now occur on a daily \nbasis over access to water points and increasingly scarce grazing land. \n232\n2.

These peripheries are \nsimultaneously wildlife habitat zones, arable land for \nfarmers and rangeland areas for pastoralists. These \noverlapping uses are increasing the risk of conflict \nover access to natural resources between pastoralists \nand farmers and between pastoralists and conserva-\ntion officers."}

During this period, over 100,000 heads of cattle may be found on the Waza-\nLogone flood plain alone. The movements in question increase the risk of over-grazing, land \ncompaction and soil degradation. The livestock carrying capacity is often more than surpassed. \nIt hovers around 17.5 Tropical Livestock Units (TLU) per hectare (Jiagho, 2018). At the end of the \n1990s, it was estimated to be between 8 and 10 TLU per hectare (UICN & CBLT, 2007). \nFurthermore, pastoralists and their herds are increasingly extending their stay past July when \nthe first rains are slow to fall. Pastoralists can establish themselves for periods lasting over six \nmonths, notably to the east of Waza National Park, a flood-prone area where there are \u00ad\nperennial \nponds. Many pastoralists establish themselves in an even more permanent manner. \nFor their part, local agropastoralists are intensifying their investments in livestock.

It is estimated that 478 ha of forest \ncover is disappearing on average each year from the areas surrounding Waza National Park \n(Jiagho et al., 2016). The natural habitat is thus being modified in an alarming manner. Wildlife \nare being affected and conflicts are deepening between conservation services and transhumant \npastoralists.

The \nanalysis of the spatial dimensions of transhumance is \nan essential prerequisite for establishing a construc-\ntive dialogue between the managers of protected \nareas and pastoralists, which then makes it possible \nto precisely identify the determinants of pastoralists\u2019 \nactions and the role of the protected area and its \nperiphery in their lives. \nTo do so, it is vital to consider several interlocking \nlevels. The first level covers the set of routes that lead \nto the protected area in question, from the pastoralists\u2019 \ndeparture point to the dry season pastures targeted \n(Figure\u202f3). The second level designates the stages of \nthe transhumance route, before and after the protected \narea (departure point, rapid travel area without \npermanent water points, transit area and arrival area, \ndepending on the position of the protected area along \nthe route).

The BSB Yamoussa complex is surrounded by several zones of hunting interest (referred \nto below by their French acronym, ZIC) in Cameroon and a peripheral area in Chad. These \ntwo protected areas are under multiple and intensifying external pressures generating agro-\u00ad\nsylvo-pastoral conflicts linked to an intensification of migration, the gradual encroachment \nof agropastoral activities, the development of mining activities (uncontrolled gold mining), \nconflictual management of transhumance and an escalation of poaching. The rapid advance \nof the agricultural front in particular is increasing the difficulties involved in moving transhu-\nmant herds and is heightening the risk of multi-faceted land conflicts. The vast majority of \nBSB is covered by infertile land unsuitable for agriculture. At the end of the dry season, water \nbecomes scarce. The rivers, called locally mayo, are dried out and pastures are degraded. \nAccess to water, even more than pastures, is the major problem for both livestock and wildlife. \n \nFigure\u202f8 \u2013 Transhumance and land occupation in BSB Yamoussa area"}
{"text":"241\nSince 2014, several studies undertaken under the framework to resolve the issue of transhu-\nmance in Cameroon (North and Far North) made it possible to identify the spatial, social, \neconomic, technical and political dimensions of transhumance in the area. \nExclusively nomadic Peuls form a very small minority. Most transhumant pastoralists make \nseasonal movements without crossing borders. Most are crop-livestock farmers or agropas-\ntoralists. The herds, with 40 to 60 heads, are shepherded by herdsmen from the Garoua area \nin the north. Cross-border seasonal transhumance between Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria also \nexists, most often practiced by young hired herdsmen. Herds moving from Chad towards \nCameroon are larger than those coming from Nigeria, or those which are from Cameroon \nand moving towards Chad. In principle, everyone knows the major transhumance corridors \ndefined by a decree from the ministry in charge of livestock. Small and medium transhumance \ncorridors are determined by more local and customary practices. Transhumant pastoralists \ncomplain that crop fields are spilling over onto these corridors. \nThese preparatory studies made it possible to now build elements for a consultation process \ninvolving the different actors, reconcile points of view, and guide future interventions in the \ncross-border context of the BSB Yamoussa complex on the basis of a genuine involvement \nof local communities. It turns out that the local populations recognize the importance of \nprotected areas, particularly their capacity to slow down the development of the agricultural \nfront. They nonetheless are advocating for an increase in land allocated to crop and livestock \nfarming. In other words, they accept the parks, but are less tolerant of the ZIC surrounding the \nparks. The issue of ZICs will therefore be a priority for support action in the park peripheries. \nSetting up a mechanism to prevent and manage conflicts related to transhumance should \nenable the establishment of constructive dialogue and positive relationships between the \nmanagers of the protected areas and the users of the BSB space, and ensure the sustainable \nuse of goods and services provided by the natural environments.\nThe binational Sena-Oura - Bouba-Ndjida (BSB) Yamoussa complex"}
{"text":"242\nThis step of understanding the route in its entirety \nmakes it possible to assess the strategies of different \ntypes of transhumant pastoralists. It enables an under-\nstanding of how pastoralists consider the periphery \nof a protected area within the broader context of the \nentire route: an essential area after a rapid movement \nwith the herds, a transit area, a final destination, etc. \nDepending on the position of the protected area on \nthe transhumance routes, management issues may be \ndifferent as the animals\u2019 needs and the pastoralists\u2019 \nobjectives will not necessary be the same. The \u00ad\nmeasures \nto implement at the local level by the manager of the \nprotected area could then be different depending on \nthe situation. \n2.2.4 Consider the role of transhumant \npastoralists in the management of insecurity\nOverall, transhumant pastoralism helps to make \nthe most of vast remote areas, ensuring a human pres-\nence in isolated regions within countries facing major \nsecurity challenges (OCDE, 2014).  It is an essential \nline of defense against insecurity by the occupation of \nthe space. The relationship between herd mobility and \nsecurity can, however, work both ways (COMIFAC \n& GIZ, 2019). Pastoralists often are the first victims \nof rebel groups and bandits involved in large-scale \npoaching.

Depending on the context, this \ncan be undertaken in different ways, one example \nbeing the development of basic services for transhu-\nmant pastoralists in the peripheries of protected areas. \nManagers of protected areas must position them-\nselves at the heart of development and security issues \nas territory actors alongside other sociopolitical actors."}

For \nexample, their ability to respond to the challenges of \nclimate change and insecurity is generally limited. As \na result, they are losing some of their legitimacy, and \nmany pastoralists and new herd owners are turning \ntheir backs on their authority.

{"text":"243\nthe shared and sensible use of natural resources. \nSupport given to these institutions by the managers \nof protected areas encourages local diplomacy and \npromotes inclusive agreements. \nFor example, in the context of Faro National Park \nin Cameroon, these initiatives have facilitated the \nestablishment of agreements on mobility and the \nassessment of the carrying capacity on the busiest \ngrazing areas, and influenced the perception of the \nstakeholders concerned. Support for the Network of \nTranshumant Associations of Greater Faro, led by \nthe Lamido of Tchamba (a traditional Peul chief), \nis enabling diverse actors to discuss and negotiate \ndifferent questions related to the management of \npastoral mobility around the national park. On both \nsides of the border between Cameroon and Nigeria, all \nthose directly concerned were already linked tradition-\nally, but alliance systems were losing their legitimacy. \nWith the Lamido\u2019s support, this network made it \npossible to rekindle interest across transhumant \ncommunities as a whole, and to include other issues in \nlocal debates, such as combating insecurity (the park \nhad become a refuge for hostage takers and highway \nbandits) and the protection of natural resources. \nTraditional institutions also can be strengthened \nby becoming integrated into broader collaboration \nplatforms. The Actors Forum from Faro is another \nexample of a multi-stakeholder and multi-sectoral \nplatform.

{"text":"250\nThe countries of Central Africa are distinguished by the abundance of both their \nbiodiversity and natural resources, particularly minerals, gas and oil. This dual wealth \ncould offer extraordinary opportunities for development if it is governed wisely \nand revenues are shared equitably (Mar\u00e9chal, 2013). The economic growth and \nemergence plans drawn up by the States rely mainly on the exploitation of mineral \nresources. While mining and oil industries can be sources of employment (albeit \ngenerally modest) and wealth, they also can cause substantial environmental and \nsocioeconomic damage (Carbonnier, 2013; Mar\u00e9chal, 2013; Noiraud et al.,\u00a02017; \nChuhan-Pole et al., 2020). However, this damage can be mitigated, and\u00a0there \nalso are potential opportunities for investments in biodiversity protection.\nCountries in the subregion grew by an average \nof 5.8% between 2001-2012, compared to 3.0% \nbetween 1990-2000, enabling Central Africa to \nrecord the second highest growth rate in Africa over \nthis period (BAD, 2013). This performance gener-\nated a surge of optimism regarding their economic \ndevelopment prospects. Unfortunately, the antic-\nipated upturn was short-lived, with growth rates \ndropping to 1.1% in 2017, rising slightly to 2.2% \nin 2018 (BAD, 2019), only to be followed by the \ncrisis induced by the Covid-19 pandemic that began \nin early 2020 (BAD, 2020). This weak performance \nis largely due to limited local processing capacities \nfor raw materials, which are mostly exported unpro-\ncessed, thereby reducing the value added of these \nproducts. Similarly, fluctuations in the price of raw \nmaterials on the international market contribute to \nthe vulnerability of economies based on the export \nof these raw materials, including minerals. Most \nof the major mining projects, particularly iron ore \nexploitation, also have not yet materialized due to \nthe fall in ore prices on the international market, a \nphenomenon linked to increased iron production in \nother regions of the world."}

This biodiversity take a considerable \npart in national economies. For example, the forests \nof the Congo Basin contribute 18% of GDP in the \nCentral African Republic (CAR) and 20% of foreign \nexchange earnings in Cameroon (Tieguhong & \nNdoye, 2007). To ensure the in situ protection of this \nbiodiversity, numerous protected areas were created, \nover which diverse and often antagonistic economic \ninterests are now competing.\nProtected areas contain not only a wealth of \nbiodiversity, but also subsoil that can be important \nreservoirs of mineral resources (minerals, oil, and \ngas). These resources are coveted by multinational \nfirms as well as small-scale prospectors. In Gabon, \nfor example, the Gamba Complex of Protected Areas \ncontains a wide diversity of habitats and species as \nwell as the country\u2019s largest onshore oil reserves (Dall-\nmeier et al., 2006). Oil reserves also have been found \nin other protected areas, including Virunga National \nPark and Salonga National Park in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo (DRC), two of the most \nimportant protected areas in Central Africa. Virunga \nhosts the richest biodiversity of all the protected \nareas in the subregion (Plumptre et al., 2017), while \nSalonga is the largest forest park in Africa and one of \nthe very first in the world."}

In terms of environmental impacts, one can distinguish:\n\t\n\u2013 direct impacts, caused by the extraction activity and which occur at the same time \nand in the same place (degradation of plant cover, soil and groundwater pollution, \netc., on the operating site);\n\t\n\u2013 indirect impacts, caused by the extraction activity but which occur later or further \naway from the site (long distance pollution of the water table or atmosphere, decline \nin human health, dwindling wildlife, etc.).

They also are reasonably predictable;\n\t\n\u2013 major changes in local economies, culture, infrastructure use, employment, or \nhuman migration that may be generated by extraction and transportation activi-\nties and which are more difficult to characterize and quantify.

Consequently, the sector is dominated by large \nmultinational companies with vertically integrated \nvalue chains. It is characterized by high profits that \nfluctuate according to international market prices and \nextraction costs. \nGiven the importance of the sector to the conti-\nnent, in 2009 the African Union adopted a general \nframework for the development of mining resources \ncalled the Africa Mining Vision (AMV), comple-\nmented in 2011 by an action plan (Union Africaine \net al., 2011). AMV recommends improving the condi-\ntions for negotiating mining contracts, paying more \nattention to the environment, and ensuring the best \nuse of natural resources and the development of \nAfrican skills. Unfortunately, the implementation of \nAMV at the national level has been slow to mate-\nrialize.

The fact remains that many Central African \ncountries, despite their extensive natural resources \nand surges in growth when oil and mineral prices \nrise, have not been able to convert their underground \nwealth into harmonious and sustainable development \nfor their people. \nThe main causes are inadequate legislative and \ninstitutional frameworks, weak and poorly enforced \nenvironmental and social standards, a lack of transpar-\nency and governance principles, and a still incipient \nfreedom of expression and debate.

In 2020, the \ncrisis triggered by the coronavirus epidemic led to \na drop in prices that may prove to be catastrophic \nfor growth and government revenues, although the \ndecrease in government revenues could be offset, at \nleast in part, by increased production (Mbadi, 2020). \nAlthough prices have been rising since the end of \nNovember\u202f2020, pointing to a better year in 2021, \nthey remain relatively unstable, dependent on both \nthe recovery of the global economy and negotiations \nbetween producing countries (Aufrand, 2021).\nAcross all of Central Africa, the oil and gas \nclaims that have been granted or are open and in the \nprocess of being contracted amount to approximately \n520\u202fclaims, and currently cover nearly 2,590,000\u2009km2 \n(Figure\u202f3). These numbers refer mainly to oil (and oil \nand gas) claims, with gas-only claims representing a \nvery small minority. Of this total, almost 297\u202fclaims \nhave been awarded that cover an area of almost \n920,000\u2009km2. Many awarded claims are in the explora-\ntion phase, and most of the claims in the exploitation \nphase are offshore. \nWith the notable exception of Chad, a landlocked \ncountry, and a few onshore fields in Gabon, most of the \noil produced in Central Africa comes from offshore \nreserves. The oil is relatively easy to produce and safe \nfrom potential security issues, unlike oil produced \nonshore. Offshore production has the advantage of \nlimiting potentially conflictual interactions between \ncompanies and local communities, allowing produc-\ntion to be protected from social and civil unrest."}

However, two new \nelements should be considered. First, in 2017 Gabon \ncreated the largest network of marine reserves in \nAfrica, covering more than 50,000\u2009km2 (UNEP-\nWCMC & IUCN, 2020). This suggests that there \nwill be significant interactions in the future between \nprotected areas and oil exploitation, due to both the \nexisting, largely offshore activity and new, recently \nidentified marine deposits (Mbadinga, 2018). The \ncurrent or foreseeable impacts of these extractive \nactivities must be controlled and reduced as much as \npossible (pollution and traffic, in particular).  \nThe second element to bear in mind is that the \nrelatively limited nature of onshore oil exploitation"}

{"text":"267\n\u00ad\noperators are electricity shortages and the dilapidated \nstate of land infrastructure, which severely limits \nthe transportation of mining commodities (DGT, \n2020c). In addition, mining companies are sometimes \nforced to suspend operations due to volatile security \n\u00ad\nsituations in some regions (Anon., 2019b).\nIt should be noted that gold and certain minerals \nsuch as coltan are mainly mined in an artisanal \nmanner in DRC. In fact, many of these minerals are \nmined illegally and leave the country without being \naccounted for and without the miners paying the \ngovernment taxes on them (DGT, 2020d; Smith, \n2020). The high level of exports of gold and some \nminerals from Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda owe \nmuch to DRC. In the case of Rwanda, the country \nhas put in place a land use planning and cadas-\ntral system that has made it possible to legalize and \norganize mining much more efficiently compared to \nother countries in the subregion (Warnest et al., 2012; \nLehman et al., 2017). The large number of registered \npermits, relative to the small size of the country, is \nindicative of this (see Figure\u202f3a). \nGabon also has been recognized as a mining \ncountry for about half a century. The country is \nlocated in the \u201cheart of the Congo Craton\u201d, and has \nexploited industrial deposits of uranium and manga-\nnese for decades. It also has extensive iron and gold \ndeposits.

Consequently, \nmany exploration projects begun in 2005 in Gabon, \nCongo and Cameroon following an upturn in global \niron prices ultimately were not implemented. \nIn Congo, vast potash deposits have been under \nstudy for several years (Kouilou region, on the coun-\ntry\u2019s Atlantic coast)."}

These deposits will \nundoubtedly lead to heavy environmental impacts \nin southern Congo. Quite recently, semi-industrial \ngold mining by Chinese operators has developed very \nrapidly in the Congo section of the TRIDOM inter-\nzone, causing considerable environmental impacts \n(water pollution) and presenting strong competition \nto artisanal gold miners (Noiraud et al., 2017)."}
{"text":"268\n3. Are extractive industries \na\u00a0danger for protected areas \nand\u00a0biodiversity conservation?\n3.1 Pressure from extractive industries \non protected areas\nMany oil and mining, industrial, semi-industrial \nand\/or artisanal operations are located near or straddle \nprotected areas. When operating, these mining and oil \nclaims put considerable pressure on natural resources \nwithin and near protected areas. \nBy their very nature, mining operations cause \nsignificant direct damage to the environment through \nsoil stripping and the chemical pollution of soils and \nwaterways, destroying aquatic biodiversity in the \nprocess (Noiraud et al., 2017; Voundi et al., 2019). \nThese activities also are likely to damage human and \nanimal health through heavy metal pollution, as is the \ncase in Katanga, DRC (Kahilu Mutshma et al., 2015; \nMateso, 2016). All of these risks and damage could be \nmitigated if laws governing mining and rules of good \ngovernance were strictly enforced. Unfortunately, the \nmining sector in many Central African countries is \nplagued by institutions which have been subverted to \nserve the elites, corruption, a lack of transparency, poor \nrevenue redistribution and low societal \u00ad\nparticipation \n(Philippot, 2009).\nOne should note that with regard to the impact of \nextractive industries on protected areas, the construc-\ntion of mineral transportation infrastructure (mining \nsites, roads, railroads, pipelines, etc.), and migratory \nflows involving workers, job seekers and their fami-\nlies, generally exert tremendous pressure on natural \nresources (deforestation, poaching, etc.) that surpasses \nthe direct impact of the exploitation itself (Reed & \nMiranda, 2007; Noiraud et al., 2017). Hunting pres-\nsure is mainly focused on protected areas because they \nremain wildlife reservoirs and they are not, for many \nreasons, always managed effectively. \nAs mentioned earlier, mining projects attract \npoor populations. These communities generally do \nnot benefit from the mining projects; they are there \nto feed and supply mining centers and camps with \nvarious materials such as hunting meat, charcoal and \nvarious forest products."}

All of this generally results in \na degradation of living conditions and the environ-\nment (Voundi et al., 2019; Chuhan-Pole et al., 2020).\nNumerous NGO reports and scientific studies \nalso denounce the human rights violations associ-\nated with mining (HCDH, 2010; CREF, 2015). The \nmining sector has been known to have close links \nto armed groups and accept practices of enslave-\nment and pauperization when the interests of a \nfew key actors are at stake. Gold mining and coltan \nexploitation in eastern DRC are clear examples \n(Le Billon & Hocquard, 2007). Human misery and \ninsecurity are two essential ingredients for the uncon-\ntrolled exploitation of natural resources, including \n\u00ad\nbiodiversity. Protected areas are paying the price.\nUnder these conditions, if governments strengthen \nprotected area conservation and management meas-\nures, and mining operators implement environmental \nand social management plans effectively and effi-\nciently, the effects of these multiple pressures can be \nmitigated. However, there remains significant room \nfor improvement in the systematic implementation of \nenvironmental impact assessments and the applica-\ntion of the avoid-reduce-offset sequence at all stages \nof mining projects (Cigorogo et al., 2020). The mining \nsector still generates significant environmental and \nsocial impacts that could be avoided or minimized."}
{"text":"269\n3.2 Land use planning in question\nThe problem posed by claims granted to extrac-\ntive industries that overlap protected areas reflects \nthe pre-eminence of one land use over another. It is \nprimarily a land use planning issue (Doumenge et al., \n2016). Unfortunately, few Central African countries \nhave implemented or plan to develop an integrated, \nparticipatory, transparent approach to spatial plan-\nning and land use. Constrained by a small geographic \narea and a very large population, Rwanda imple-\nmented a land tenure legalization system and a land \nuse plan that were mainly intended to strengthen \nsocial peace and promote agricultural production \n(Ali et al., 2014; Chigbu et al., 2019; RNRA, 2020). \nHowever, the plan also made it possible to safeguard \nareas dedicated to biodiversity protection. Other \ncountries, such as DRC, Cameroon and Gabon, \nhave indicated an intention to implement land \nuse plans, but the process of preparing these plans \nhas\u00a0barely begun.\nLand use decisions involve weighing the value \nof biodiversity and the ecosystem services that \nbiodiversity provides against the economic value \nof extractive activities. On the one hand, the \nimportance of biodiversity and forests are rarely \nrecognized and are systematically underestimated, \nincluding their contribution to maintaining ecolog-\nical balances, combating climate change, the survival \nof the poorest and employment (see, for example, \nchapters 9 and 10 of this book). On the other hand, \nthe large sums of money involved in large oil and \nmining projects are emphasized, although the social \nbenefits delivered by multinationals often are not \n\u2013\u202for at least very inadequately\u202f\u2013 commensurate with \nthe taxes and revenues they pay to States (Kolk & \nLenfant, 2010; Noiraud et al., 2017). In the vast \nmajority of cases, mining revenues remain concen-\ntrated in just a few hands and the sector does not \npromote the development of diversified and stable \neconomies, stifling in advance any attempt to \ndevelop a \u00ad\nsustainable \u00ad\nbiodiversity economy."}

On land, the strongest potential impacts of oil \nexploitation can be expected in swamp forests, which \nare more easily subjected to pollution (Ite et al., 2013). \nEverywhere, production and disposal infrastructure \nand indirect impacts will be significant, at least under \ncurrent conditions. During the exploration phase, the \ndestruction of forests also can cause significant impacts, \nparticularly if the soil is fragile, as is the case in coastal \nsedimentary basins (Doumenge, 1992).\n3.4 Overlap of mining concessions \nand\u00a0protected areas\n3.4.1 Central Africa\nIn Central Africa, at least for seven of the ten \ncountries concerned, there are currently almost \n4,590 awarded mining contracts covering an area of \n502,150\u2009km2.

The quarry in Zombe is the \nmost striking case. \nThis quarry is located northwest of the reserve (Figure\u202f10) and includes several artisanal \ncassiterite mines. It is equipped with a fair amount of infrastructure, which will enable it to \nsoon become a new village inside the reserve.

This is particu-\nlarly true of mercury pollution, the effects of which on human and ecosystem health in the \nTRIDOM cannot currently be assessed. It is also a question of encouraging and reserving \ngold mining activities for national citizens, under the framework of a reorganization of the \ngold sales channels controlled by the States. \nIn Gabon, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Equatoriale des Mines (SEM), plans to support the creation of gold \nminer cooperatives.

They generally have little knowl-\nedge of the economic value of possible synergies \nbetween production and conservation areas due to the \npoor dissemination of conservation texts and to a lack \nof information flows between institutional actors and \nprivate sector operators. \nIn order to combat this misperception of protected \nareas by private sector companies and local commu-\nnities, and therefore the lack of attention paid to \nthem at the political level, knowledge must be better \ndisseminated in society. Environmental education \nand information, professional training on biodiversity \nand its importance (supply of products and services to \nhuman societies), must be developed. In the forestry \nsector, the incorporation of new knowledge has made \nit possible to promote sustainable exploitation with \ndual environmental and socioeconomic benefits.

It is essential that this situ-\nation be remedied. First, all countries must join or \nre-join EITI and submit comprehensive reports on \na regular basis.\nSecond, in addition to legal requirements, which \noften fall short of international standards, extractive \nindustries must be part of a sustained improvement \ndynamic in the field, and internalize good prac-\ntices with regard to taking biodiversity into account \nin their operations. They must comply with IFC \nstandards and the Equator Principles. Supported by \nIUCN, the International Council on Mining and \nMetals (ICMM) also has developed a practical guide \nfor extractive industries (ICMM, 2006). This guide, \nas its name suggests, provides mining operators with \na set of tools, approaches and requirements that can \nhelp them minimize their footprint on biodiversity \nand thus improve their credibility with investors"}

This guide, which should be \nupdated with regard to recent technological develop-\nments in the mining sector, could also inspire reforms \nof laws governing the exploration and exploitation of \nmines and metals.\nThe real challenge facing Central African countries \nis the need to conciliate a desire to promote economic \ndevelopment on the one hand with the preservation of \nthe region\u2019s rich ecological and human heritage on the \nother. Governments must promote proactive policies \nthat integrate environmental and social concerns into \nall extractive activities in order to encourage mining \noperations that truly contribute to the sustainable \ndevelopment of their countries. This also means that \nboth effective incentive systems and credible control \nand penalty systems must be put in place.\n4.6 Promoting public-private \npartnerships for biodiversity conservation\nAs noted above, the nature of extractive indus-\ntries\u2019 operations can have very significant impacts on \nbiodiversity and the environment overall. Through \nenvironmental management plans based on environ-\nmental and social impact studies, extractive industries \ncommit to preventing, minimizing and repairing the \ndamage they may cause to the environment during \ntheir operations (the avoid-reduce-offset sequence). \nDespite their possible willingness to do so, mining \nand oil companies do not always have either the \ncapacity or experience to contribute to biodiver-\nsity conservation to an extent that could offset the \n\u00ad\nnegative impacts they may create.\nIt is therefore important to examine the possi-\nbility of promoting partnerships between extractive \nindustries, governments and NGOs or private \npartners working in the field of conservation. This \nis the case of traditional organizations such as \nWWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), IUCN and \nWCS (Wildlife Conservation Society), and more \nrecently established organizations such as African \nParks Network (APN). This type of Public-\u00ad\nPrivate \nPartnership (PPP) can effectively organize the \ncontribution of extractive industries to protected area \nmanagement and biodiversity conservation efforts \nthrough alliances between different stakeholders \nwith complementary skills and responsibilities. \nThe example of Shell in the Gamba protected area \ncomplex in Gabon is quite instructive in this regard \n(Dallmeier et al., 2006; Moussotsi Ikapi, 2016)."}

Conclusion\nIn Central Africa, although fluctuating commodity \nprices, particularly for oil and iron, and the Covid-19 \nepidemic have slowed the development of extractive \nindustries in recent years, revenues from oil, gas and \nmining still form the bedrock of public finances. These \nindustries provide the bulk of export revenues, and \noften have done so for several decades, as evidenced \nby the large number of mining, oil and gas contracts \nand the extent of the land which they occupy. \nExtractive contracts currently cover 60% of \nCentral Africa\u2019s protected area network and 60% of \nthe subregion\u2019s intact forest landscapes. Moreover, oil \nand gas claims cover 100% of the maritime exclusive \neconomic zones, whether or not these areas are clas-\nsified as protected areas. Virtually the entire Chad \nBasin is covered by petroleum claims, as is the Central \nCongo Basin, including very fragile aquatic and"}

Waitkuwait, GIZ\nThe Foundation for the Environment and Development in Cameroon (FEDEC) was \ncreated in 2001 as part of the Environmental Management Plan for the Chad-Cameroon \nPipeline Project. This pipeline allows oil to be transported from fields in southern Chad to \nCameroon\u2019s Atlantic coast in the Kribi region. FEDEC manages a trust fund intended to \npay some compensation for the project\u2019s adverse effects on the environment (ecological \nand social). Protected area managers and the private sector must work in partnership, \nled by the World Bank, the government of Cameroon and a consortium of oil companies \ninvolved in the pipeline development.\nThe funds are generated by compensation payments for project impacts by Exxon-\nMobil, Chevron and Petronas, and made by COTCO, the company in charge of managing \nthe pipeline. They are intended to finance the development and management of Mbam \nand Djerem and Campo-Ma\u2019an National Parks, and to support sustainable agriculture \nand the improvement of education and health systems for the Bakola\/Bagyeli indige-\nnous peoples between Lolodorf and Kribi.

The coordinate system used was WGS \n1984 Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere. The layout \nof national borders of Central Africa were obtained \nfrom Open Stream maps. \nData defining the spatial location of mining \nconcessions were obtained from the SNL Metals \nand Mining database (accessed on 02\/12\/2020).

{"text":"310\nTourism has become an important industry worldwide, accounting for 10.3% \nof\u00a0global GDP in 2019 (WTTC, 2020). It contributes significantly to the creation \nof jobs in some countries, especially for women, youth, migrant workers, rural \ncommunities and indigenous peoples (Kamga Kamdem et al., 2020). It can \ndrive other economic sectors such as agriculture, transport, construction, and \ntelecommunications (WTTC, 2020). Tourism also is one of the main ways to both \nintegrate protected areas into local and global economies and generate funding to \ncover, at least in part, their management costs (UICN-PACO, 2010; WTTC, 2019). \nBefore the crisis resulting from the Covid-19 \npandemic, the global tourism industry was growing \nat a remarkable rate (WTTC, 2020). It accounted for \n5.8% of all exports and 4.5% of global investments \n(Christie et al., 2013). In 2020, however, Covid-19 \nhalted this trend and tourism fell sharply around the \nworld (UNWTO, 2020a & e; WTTC, 2021). Various \nrecovery strategies are being considered, but it will \nnot be possible to measure their effectiveness imme-\ndiately. In the opinion of many experts, the sector \nmay undergo profound change, with an increase \nin domestic tourism, tourism that is more oriented \ntoward nature and open spaces, and tourism that is \nmore responsible with regard to its impacts (G\u00f6ssling \net al., 2020; UNWTO, 2020d; Bhammar et al., 2021; \nSpenceley et al. 2021). \nAfrica, covering 22% of the Earth\u2019s surface, received \nabout 4% of global international arrivals 10 years ago, \nwhen it held 15% of the world\u2019s population.

Only a few countries have begun to set \nup proactive tourism policies and strategies, such as \nRwanda and Sao Tome and Principe, based notably \non their protected area networks.\nThe subregion\u2019s protected areas may be a prime \nmedium for the development of tourism activities, in \nparticular ecotourism and wildlife viewing tourism. \nTourism therefore could play an important role in \nbiodiversity protection, providing opportunities \nfor the socio-economic development of protected \nareas and economic justification for the protection \nof species and ecosystems (UICN-PACO, 2010; \nMossaz et al., 2015; Leung et al., 2019; WTTC, \n2019). Wildlife tourism directly accounted for \nUS$120.1\u202fbillion of global GDP in 2018, more than \nfive times the estimated value of illegal wildlife traf-\nficking; when induced effects on other sectors are \ntaken into account, the total economic contribu-\ntion amounts to US$343.6\u202fbillion (WTTC, 2019). \nIn Africa, wildlife viewing tourism accounts for \none-third of tourism revenues. \nThis type of tourism is closely linked to seeing \nAfrica\u2019s iconic large wildlife in protected areas \n(mega-herbivores and large carnivores, which have \nlargely disappeared elsewhere).

Tourism development policies \nand strategies are just beginning to be formulated, and \ngovernments do not appear to be giving the attention \nneeded to their implementation. This activity continues \nto face many obstacles, including red tape, complex visa \nrequirements, poor infrastructure, insecurity and armed \nconflict, lack of specialized skills, lack of investment \nand an unfavorable business climate (Viard, 2008; \nKimbu & Tichaawa, 2018; Kamga Kamdem et al., \n2020; Maisonneuve & Poliwa, 2020).\nRwanda has nevertheless managed to overcome \nthese weaknesses and could inspire other countries in \ntheir respective efforts.

Masi, MNHN\nMountain gorilla viewing tourism as a model?\nIn Rwanda, Uganda and DRC, wildlife viewing tourism of eastern gorillas, particularly of \nmountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), has been very successful. It has contributed \nsubstantially to the operating costs of protected areas, as well as the local and national \neconomy of their range countries (Hatfield & Malleret-King 2007; Moyini & \u00ad\nUwimbabazi \n2000; Nielsen & Spenceley 2011). The success of mountain gorilla-based tourism has \nattracted the attention of other Central African countries in the hope that similar revenue \ncould be obtained from great ape-viewing tourism. However, western gorillas (G. gorilla) \nare not mountain gorillas, and lowland forests are not mountain forests."}
{"text":"315\nWestern lowland gorilla tourism is more challenging \nMost western lowland gorilla tourism projects are the outcome of intensive long-term \nresearch  programs (Blom et al., 2004; Doran-Sheehy et al., 2007). Lowland gorilla \ntourism with habituated groups has proven to be challenging and expensive. Complete \nhabituation can take up to eight years, compared to two years for mountain gorillas \n(Blom et al., 2004; Doran-Sheehy et al., 2007). \nWhile mountain gorilla groups leave clear traces on the herbaceous vegetation, lowland \ngorilla tracking requires skilled trackers to be able to find the same group every day in \nthe understory of dense forests, especially during the dry season. Moreover, lowland \ngorillas have larger overlapping home ranges, and they usually live in smaller groups. \nThis makes it crucial to follow them daily, but also makes it more difficult to track the \nsame group of gorillas, which slows the habituation process (Bradley et al., 2008). In \naddition, western gorillas are sympatric with forest elephants (L. cyclotis) throughout \ntheir home range. Elephants often are found in the same vegetation used by the gorillas \nor even near the same trees on which they feed, and can be dangerous when tourists \nare viewing the gorillas or traveling to and from habituated gorilla groups. \nWhen habituating western lowland gorillas, habituation teams must be very close to \nthe gorillas in order for the gorillas to see them. Due to the dense vegetation and flat \ntopography, it may be necessary to approach as close as 10 meters from them before \nfirst contact. Gorilla reactions to such close proximity may then be more aggressive or \nlast longer during the habituation process than with mountain gorillas. It therefore often \ntakes longer to reach the stage where gorillas can be reliably observed without the risk \nof aggressive charges. \nInvestment and operating costs can run into the hundreds of thousands of US dollars \n(Greer & Cipolletta, 2006)."}

Some projects fail to fully habituate lowland gorillas, even \nafter several years of significant financial investment (French, 2009), and others have \nlost habituated groups due to disease outbreaks (Bermejo et al., 2006). Due to the \nfamily structure of western lowland gorillas (one polygynous male), their habituation is \nalso uncertain and represents a risky investment of time and money, as groups disinte-\ngrate after the death of the group\u2019s only silverback (Stokes et al., 2003). This can negate \nall previous efforts and investments. In contrast, in multi-male mountain gorilla groups, \none of the surviving males becomes the leader of the troop following the death of the \ndominant silverback (Robbins & Robbins, 2005).  \nSome recommendations\nDeveloping a tourism project with western lowland gorillas will be more expensive and \ntime consuming than one with mountain gorillas, and will require dedicated and skilled \ntrackers.

The diversification of the tourism offer \nmust be considered at the scale of each site, but also at \nthe scale of each country and of the subregion (see the \ncross-border tourism circuit proposed by the Congo \nConservation Company; CCC, 2021).

Generally speaking, Central \nAfrican countries are fairly well connected to Euro-\npean countries, but not as well to Asian or American \ncountries. In contrast, inter-African links are both \ncomplicated and chaotic. However, thanks to \n\u00ad\nRwandAir, Rwanda has been able to establish reli-\nable and regular connections with various countries \nincluding Nigeria, which provides more and more \ntourists to \u201cthe country of a thousand hills\u201d. This \nAfrican market, which will grow with the emergence \nof wealthy and middle classes, can only develop if \nthere are better air connections.\nSome good practices \nEven on the miradors, visitors can be very intrusive and disturb wildlife. With increasing \ndemand, it becomes necessary to put in place rules (no smoking or littering, speaking \nsoftly, etc.). The presence of tourists should be limited to the platform (if it exists) and the \naccess road. Researchers also must be involved from the very beginning of the tourism \nactivity (participation in the design of the activity, scientific mediation, training of guides, \nsupport for monitoring, etc.).\nBa\u00efs with existing research projects and tourism activities should be monitored and \nprotected at all times (Breuer et al., 2015; Maisels et al., 2015b). Any new observation plat-\nform (especially those managed by communities) should only be built where monitoring \nteams can ensure protection and with a clear tourism development plan. Guidelines on \nbest practices should be established, including for the mirador and any infrastructure \nconstruction (Metsio Siena et al., 2015).  \nAny tourism program should realistically describe what can be expected in each ba\u00ef so \ntourists have realistic expectations. Additional visitor packages can be created where \npossible (overnight stay at the ba\u00ef, rental of viewing equipment, etc.). Lastly, ba\u00efs offer \nenormous potential for outreach and education; on some sites, it is possible to bring school \ngroups or to allow VIPs to easily observe wildlife.\nWildlife watching tourism from observation platforms overlooking\u00a0forest clearings"}

In 2001, the government made a 120\u2009\nkm2 area available \nto the foundation for the development of ecotourism in what later became Ivindo National \nPark (established in 2002). Within the framework of tourism activities, which began in 2005, \nFIGET collaborates with several villages in the Makokou region (Loa-Loa, Melondo Mil\u00e9l\u00e9 and \nTruhaya), IRET (Institut de Recherches en Ecologie Tropicale) and ANPN.\nActivities \nThe foundation has built a small tourism facility at Kongou Falls. Totally integrated into the \nforest, it is composed of several bungalows with a total capacity of 12-14 beds. Several tourism \nitineraries are offered to visitors, allowing for a variety of activities and levels of physical diffi-\nculty. Guides from the villages lead tourists through the forest to discover its richness and the \ntraditional uses of forest resources, including wildlife observation in ba\u00efs and a trekking circuit \nthrough the entire park."}

FIGET also received regular financial support from the Trust the Forest \nfoundation from 2005 to 2015. \nFor several years, tourism has been managed by local communities through a village coop-\nerative. This activity represents an important source of income for these communities. It also \nprovides funds for the State (park entrance), and allows external service providers to work, \nespecially for the transport of tourists and the provision of meals. \nFuture prospects\nFIGET\u2019s ecotourism project is one of the oldest tourism structures within the country\u2019s \nprotected areas, in place for nearly 17 years. Tourism directly involves the local population of \nthe park, which has taken over its management, in an original manner. The strong sense of \nownership by the villages of the tourism activity has led to increased protection of the forest \nand wildlife. Since 2005, several hunters and former poachers have become tourist guides and \nhave become the strongest defenders of the elephants and gorillas.\nThis initiative has demonstrated that a small, local reception facility can be set up in a \nprotected area far from traditional tourist circuits and can contribute to rural development. \nHowever, an insufficient number of visitors and the fact that operations ceased in 2020 raises \nquestions about its long-term survival. Contextual elements, beyond the control of FIGET \nand rural communities, also impact the economic viability of the activity, such as Gabon\u2019s \nlimited development of tourism, the high cost of living, the absence of air transport between \n\u00ad\nLibreville and Makokou, etc."}

Ecotourism in Central African \nprotected areas\n3.1 Tourism revenue\nAmong the three countries that could be \ndescribed as \u201ctourism destinations\u201d in Central Africa \n(Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Cameroon), it \nis \u2013\u202funsurprisingly (see Table\u202f2)\u202f\u2013 Rwanda that \nmakes the most of its protected areas. The Rwandan \nparks alone attract considerably more tourists and \nrevenues than any other country in the subregion \n(Table\u202f5). Only the two parks in eastern DRC \n(Kahuzi-Biega and especially Virunga) benefit from \nboth the attraction of eastern gorillas and the East \nAfrican tourism dynamic.\nMany protected areas in the subregion receive \nfewer than 100 visitors annually (numerous sites \nin Burundi, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, Equato-\nrial Guinea, DRC). These low numbers are due to \na variety of factors, such as lack of commitment by \nthe States, the remoteness and degraded state of \ntransportation routes, the non-existence of recep-\ntion and guide infrastructure and staff, non-existent \nmarketing and even security problems (see para-\ngraph 5). Often, only a small number of protected \nareas can be or are visited. Nlom et al. (2013) \nestimated that 5,200 tourists visited ten Cameroo-\nnian protected areas in 2012 (out of 28 protected \nareas surveyed at that time; Hiol Hiol et al., 2015), \nincluding over 4,000 visitors to Waza and Mount \nCameroon sites alone. \nIn most cases, the revenues generated by ecot-\nourism \u2013\u202fwhen there are revenues\u202f\u2013 are not yet \nsufficient to support a viable tourism sector (see \nthe CCC, FIGET, and GSAC boxes) or contribute \nsubstantially to protected areas\u2019 management costs; \nthe situation is similar to that described in the late \n1990s (Wilkie & Carpenter, 1999; Blom, 2000)."}

{"text":"331\nGorilla tourism in Volcanoes National Park (Rwanda)\nTourism began in Volcanoes National Park in 1974, already with the intention to act \nfor the conservation and the sustainable development of the human communities \nliving around the park. The main attraction for visitors is the opportunity to enjoy an \n\u00ad\nunforgettable experience with mountain gorillas in their natural environment. \nGorilla tourism is one of Rwanda\u2019s flagship tourism products (Visit Rwanda, 2021b and \nc). It is managed, as is all of Volcanoes National Park, by RDB. The activity is highly \nregulated: reservations must be made in advance (30% of clients book directly on the \ninternet compared to 70% via a tour operator) and clients must respect a set of strict \nrules (Visit Rwanda, 2021a). Twelve gorilla families are currently visible to tourists, and \nsix visitor permits can be issued per gorilla group daily. In 2018, 10 gorilla families were \nvisible and the number of permits was limited to a maximum of 20,000 permits per \nyear (Leung et al., 2019); this maximum since was raised to just over 35,000 annual \npermits (Visit Rwanda, 2021b).\nFees have risen dramatically since the 1980s: from US$230 to US$375 in the 2000s, \nthe rate for international visitors doubled a first time in 2012 (US$750) and a second \ntime in 2017 (US$1,500).

The growth of urban populations and of middle \nand affluent classes in Africa is leading to a growing \ndemand for recreation, reconnection with nature \nand encounters with natural heritage.\nIn several of the subregion\u2019s protected areas, envi-\nronmental education programs are being set up in \nschools, in partnership with teachers, and visits are \norganized for schoolchildren (Garamba, Nouabal\u00e9-\nNdoki, Zakouma, Akagera).

This situation, compounded by growing \npolitical unrest in neighboring countries (Chad and Nigeria), led to a significant decline in \u00ad\nvisitors, \nwhich fluctuated around 3,000 per year for most of the 1990s and 2000s. \nIn the late 2000s, pastoralists fled in droves from the unrest caused by Boko Haram in Nigeria, \ncausing an influx of livestock in and around Waza Park, increasing pressure on wildlife (Scholte, \n2013). Decades of relative stability in North Cameroon came to a dramatic end with the kidnap-\nping of French visitors in February 2013 (Preel, 2013). Visitor numbers plummeted only to regain \nslightly in the following tourist season (Figure\u202f8)."}

With the attack on a Chinese roadworkers\u2019 \ncamp in the town of Waza in May 2014 (Anon., 2014), tourism ground to a complete halt. Waza \nwas closed, opened only occasionally in 2019 and 2020 with respectively 10 and 11 visitors \nescorted by the armed forces. With the uncertainty of the Covid-19 crisis, the future of the park \nlooks increasingly bleak.  \nTourism always has been crucial to Waza, with revenues from entrance fees equaling operating \ncosts, although procedures put in place by the central government have discouraged more \nautonomous management. Many communities around Waza were involved in tourism-related \nactivities, such as handicrafts, jobs at hotels, catering, escorting tourists, etc.. In villages such as \nAndirni, guiding tourists was the main source of income, resulting in a strong spirit of conser-\nvation that promotes the protection of the park to this day (Scholte, 2005). However, with the \ndecline in tourism, conservation also has been affected. The lack of road maintenance since 2014 \n(with spiny Acacia seyal rapidly taking over the old tracks), has rendered surveillance and moni-\ntoring particularly difficult. The park\u2019s annual operating budgets, already low in 2015 (32\u202fmillion \nFCFA, or about US$58,000), had fallen further to 8\u202fmillion FCFA (US$15,000) by 2021."}

Although \nWaza has a reasonable number of guards (30), they no longer effectively control the park. \nRecent observations (March 2021) point to increased human pressure, particularly in the flood-\nplain of the park, and suggest a collapse of the kob and korrigum populations. Strikingly, local \ncommunities are calling for better protection of the park to prevent others from appropriating \nits resources (fish, grazing; Anon., 2021). Overall, species which have given Waza Park global \nimportance, such as lion, korrigum and red-fronted gazelle Eudorcas rufifrons, face the risk of \nimminent loss (Tumenta et al. 2010; Scholte, 2013). \nAlthough Boko Haram has seldom poached wildlife in the park (Kelly Pennaz et al., 2018), \nthe insecurity and resulting instability have had a devastating cascading influence, not unlike \n342"}

It received \nup to nearly 7,000 tourists in 1986, and continued to \nreceive between 3,000 and 5,000 visitors each year until \n2012 (Figure\u202f7 and 8). After that, the number of visits \ncollapsed due to security problems, and today the park \nno longer receives any visitors (see box).\nIn addition to security, the emergence of \nepidemics such as Ebola, and even the prevalence of \ncertain diseases (malaria, etc.), also are handicapping \nthe subregion. The case of the Covid-19 pandemic \nis emblematic in this respect: it caused a collapse \nin international arrivals of about 73% globally and \n63% in sub-Saharan Africa, with revenues cut in \nhalf overall (G\u00f6ssling et al., 2020; UNWTO, 2020d \n& e, 2021; WTTC, 2021).

{"text":"345\n5.2 Prospects for recovery\nThe effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on protected \nareas and tourism will be felt for several years to come. \nThere are various calls for the tourism stakeholders \nto thoroughly reform the sector in order to foster \nresilience (G\u00f6ssling et al., 2020; UNWTO, 2020d). \nIn particular, tourism ministers discussed the impor-\ntance of initiating discussions on the coordination of \nhealth protocols on a global scale in order to facilitate \nthe resumption of international travel while guaran-\nteeing the safety of travelers and populations.

A number \nof structural measures should be taken to keep the \nsector afloat and enable it to grow.

{"text":"347\n6. Conclusion\nCentral Africa has all of the potential of an excep-\ntional ecotourism destination, one that is unique in \nmany ways. From the Atlantic Ocean to the Congo \nBasin and the Albertine Rift, the subregion is full \nof natural and cultural wonders. However, it is only \nrecently that initiatives, often private, have made it \npossible to develop protected areas for tourism. While \nsome countries have already forged a tourism image, \nsuch as Cameroon \u201cAfrica in miniature\u201d, Rwanda \u201cthe \nland of a thousand hills\u201d and Sao Tome and Principe \n\u201cthe chocolate island\u201d, other countries have yet to \ncreate their own identity.\nWhile each protected area also must identify its \nown product and brand image, Central Africa must \ndevelop a regional tourism identity, which will ensure \nsynergy and increased attractiveness. When one \nspeaks about the subregion, the great primates imme-\ndiately leap to mind: Central Africa is \u201cthe land of the \ngreat apes\u201d. \nPart of the subregion may be suitable for mass \ntourism, or at least for receiving large numbers of \ntourists (coastal or savanna regions), but this is not the \ncase for the vast forest areas. Only tourism in small \naccompanied groups is possible. This, combined with \nthe subregion\u2019s environmental and cultural wealth, is \na further argument in favor of the development of \necotourism and community-based tourism. Central \nAfrica must prioritize this type of tourism.\nFollowing the example of Rwanda, the States \nare beginning to equip themselves with a certain \nnumber of legislative, human and operational means \nto supervise and boost their tourism sector. The legal \nand institutional framework still needs to be adapted \nto bring subregional and national ecotourism up to \ninternational standards. CEEAC could play a special \nrole in providing leadership, regional synergy and \nsupport to countries.\nHigh-end ecotourism already has established \nitself as a driver of tourism in Rwanda and in some \nprotected areas in the subregion (Virunga in DRC, \nOdzala-Kokoua in Congo, Zakouma in Chad)."}

The countries should thus encourage the \ncreation of tourism development centers anchored in \nthe territories, including the entire range of operators. \nTourism is both a promising and a fragile economic \nsector, vulnerable to political events and health crises \nsuch as Covid-19. In the absence of sectoral insurance \nand employment policies worthy of the name, States \nand private partners must set up tourism support \nfunds and mutual insurance companies that enable \nthe most fragile structures and communities to cope \nwith these crises. This is essential for strengthening \nthe resilience of the tourism sector and of protected \nareas in Central Africa."}

They contribute substantially to optimizing \ncarbon sequestration and storage by preventing deforestation and degradation \nof land and forest cover (Zapfack et al. 2013 and 2016; Noumi et al. 2018); \nthe\u00a0conservation of forests furthermore helps to maintain rainfall and regulate \nwater flows and local and regional climates (Makarieva et al., 2009; Nogherotto \net al., 2013; Bell et al., 2015; De Wasseige et al., 2015; Molina et al., 2019). \nProtected areas also shelter many species of animals and plants and provide a \nrange of ecosystem goods and services to human societies (Stolton et al., 2015). \nHealthy, undisturbed ecosystems enhance resilience to the effects of climate \nchange, and enable ecosystems and human populations to mitigate and\u00a0adapt \nto these changes (De Wasseige et al., 2015; Eba\u2019a Atyi, et al., 2015a). \nAlthough they face multiple pressures, the overall \nhealth of natural ecosystems in Central Africa remains \ngood.

These include the management"}
{"text":"355\n355\n\u00ad\neffectiveness and connectivity of protected areas in \nrelation to the dispersal capacities and vulnerability of \nspecies (Belle et al., 2016). \nAware of the importance of protected areas in \ncombating the damaging effects of climate change, \nCentral African countries have ratified a range of \nconventions, treaties and agreements to strengthen and \nimplement mechanisms for the sustainable manage-\nment of their protected areas. Examples include the \nimplementation of the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan for \nBiological Diversity adopted by the signatory parties \nto the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), \nAichi Target 11 and the Paris Agreement (2015). \nWith the signing of the Paris Agreement, govern-\nments decided to strengthen the global response to \nclimate change, with the aim of limiting the increase \nin global average temperature to below 2\u00b0C above \npre-industrial levels. \nTo achieve this objective, as advised by the Inter-\ngovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; \nGIEC, 2018), various scientists recommend reducing \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 \nand achieving neutral emissions (offset by capture) \nby 2070. Considerable international efforts will be \nrequired to achieve this as figures unfortunately reveal \na sustained rise in emissions, including in the areas \nof agriculture, forestry, and more broadly, land use \n(Shukla et al., 2019). \nAlthough fossil fuel use and industrial processes \naccount for nearly 80% of greenhouse gas emissions \n(GIEC, 2018), increasing attention is being paid \nto agriculture and forestry due to their combined \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation potential. \nIPCC recently addressed the issue of land use and \nthe measures to be implemented in this area, which \ninclude reducing deforestation, the reforestation and \nrestoration of land and ecosystems, changing land \nmanagement methods such as agroforestry, better fire \nmanagement, long-term integration of organic coals \nin soils, and improving livestock management\u00a0(Shukal \net al., 2019). All of these measures, combined with \nenergy efficiency and an increase in the share of green \nenergy in the energy mix, represent today the first \nsteps toward sustainable development."}

Contribution of protected areas \nto the fight against climate change\nGlobal warming is presenting new challenges to \nthe sustainable management of natural resource in \nprotected areas. This is particularly due to the fact that \nprotected areas are a \u201cspatially static\u201d management tool \n(the boundaries of protected areas are fixed) facing \na \u201cspatially dynamic\u201d problem (climate variability, \ndispersion and adaptation of species). This problem \ncan be addressed in part through more effective and \nadaptive management of protected areas. However, \nall this leads to an examination of the capacity of \nprotected areas to serve as an important mechanism \nto combat climate change (Halpin, 1997; Heller & \nZavaleta 2009). If managed effectively, protected \nareas can indeed play a major role in both adaptation \nand mitigation. \n1.1 Mitigating climate change\nThe importance of Central African forests\nAfrican ecosystems play a significant role in \nclimate change mitigation, storing just over one \nquarter of the 375\u2009Gt of above-ground biomass in \nthe intertropical zone (375\u202fx\u202f109 t, Avitabile et al., \n2016; Figure\u202f1).

{"text":"359\n359\nEstimating the contribution of protected areas to the protection \nof carbon stocks in Central Africa\nQ. Jungers, OFAC and P.

This OFAC study is one of several currently \nunderway to assess whether this ecosystem service could be used as a new instrument \nsupporting the sustainable financing of protected areas.  \nTo roughly estimate the total amounts of carbon stored in vegetation and soil in \nprotected areas, OFAC compiled a set of available data on the main carbon reservoirs: \nabove-ground carbon, below-ground carbon and soil organic carbon. The FAO GSOC \nmap (2020) was used to obtain soil organic carbon data at a resolution of 1\u2009\nkm. By \napplying a coefficient of 0.5 to the GLOBIOMASS map (ESA DUE, 2020), which lists all \nterrestrial above-ground biomass at a 100\u2009\nm spatial resolution, the mass of dry matter \nwas converted into above-ground carbon. Finally, multiplying the figures provided by \nthis map by a root-stem coefficient provided by IPCC, and applied to all ecological \nzones present in Central Africa (FAO, 2012), provided the results for the remaining \nreservoir: below-ground carbon.\nThe distribution between the three reservoirs (Figure\u202f3a) seems to indicate a signif-\nicant contribution from above-ground biomass, particularly due to the presence of \ndense forests, and from soil organic carbon. Recent discoveries of carbon stored in \nCentral African peatlands suggest that these magnitudes could be revised upwards \n(Dargie et al., 2017). At this point, the results obtained for Central African protected \nareas must be considered as rough estimates. They indicate the order of magnitude \nof protected areas\u2019 importance in regard to carbon storage, but they will need to be \nclarified in the future. \nThese results, coupled with a fair price per ton of carbon, point to the emergence of a \nnew tool for sustainable financing of protected areas in Central Africa, particularly forest \nprotected areas. To do so, the potential of each protected area will need to be analyzed."}

This vulnerability \ndepends on intrinsic and extrinsic factors, exposure \nto identified changes, sensitivity of the species to \nthese changes and its adaptability (Williams et al., \n2008; Foden et al., 2013; De Wasseige et al., 2015: \n57 and 58). \nAlthough many studies have focused on the \nresponse of biodiversity to climate constraints, \ndata on the mechanisms through which biodiver-\nsity adapts to climate change, and especially on the \nlimits of this adaptability, remain patchy, and under-\nstanding of these mechanisms remains limited.

It \nis projected that 20 to 30% of plant species will face \na greater risk of extinction if global warming exceeds \n1.5\u00b0C to 2.5\u00b0C (Parry et al., 2007; Busby et al., 2012). \nThis makes it all the more important to identify the \nareas that could allow vulnerable species to survive. \nTo do so, both ecological modeling (Hulme et al., \n2001; Bell et al., 2015; Tsalefack et al., 2015; Tamoffo \net al., 2019) and paleoecology (Willis et al., 2013) \napproaches are required. Knowledge of past changes \nin the climate and their effects on ecosystems has \nhelped identify former forest refuge areas that could \nprefigure, at least to some extent, future forest refuges \n(Maley et al., 2018).

Once biodi-\nversity begins to crumble, the human species is itself \nin danger. Protecting and managing these resources \nin a sustainable manner appears essential, and \nfighting for the preservation of forest ecosystems and \nwildlife is necessary to stave off the most common \ntypes of threats and to reflect on mitigation solutions \n(Ongolo & Karsenty, 2011). \nClimate variability is posing a significant threat for \nAfrican populations and communities.

Most studies have demonstrated that climate \nchange is having a negative impact on the produc-\ntivity of food crops in Africa. Although farmers have \ndemonstrated their capacity to adapt to past climatic \nand environmental variations in the past, their ability \nto overcome future challenges will depend on their \nknowledge and the support policies implemented by \ngovernments (Challinor et al., 2007). \nRecent data cover certain aspects of climate change \nand human health, including infectious diseases \n(Chan et al., 1999; Martens, 1999; Patz et al., 2000) \nand vector-borne diseases (Sutherst, 1993; Gubler \net al., 2001).

The pressure that \nclimate change is exerting on the distribution of \nspecies underscores the need to set up conservation \nstrategies at local, national and international scales to \nachieve conservation goals (Ricard, 2014). \nAt present, protected area managers in Central \nAfrica have not yet clearly identified reference species \n(fauna and flora) or biological indicators that could \nenable us to accurately measure the vulnerability \nof species and protected area networks to climate \nchange.

{"text":"385\n385\n4.1 Challenges of mobilizing funds \nfor\u00a0protected areas \nStrengthening the importance of protected \nareas in political agendas\nThe main actions supported by the Global Climate \nFund in Central Africa concern clean energy produc-\ntion projects (solar) and some land-use planning \nand reforestation projects (GCF, 2020a). These two \nsectors illustrate the key elements of strategies to fight \nclimate change, with on the one hand the promotion \nof low-carbon development (low-carbon economies, \ndeployment of \u201cgreen\u201d energies) and, on the other, \ncarbon storage (maintaining and increasing stocks). \nProtected areas are important land management \ntools that can be used to halt deforestation and the \nreduction of carbon stocks. They promote long-term \ncarbon storage and increased stocks in areas where \nforests are regenerating. Moreover, protected areas \nmake it possible to develop actions for the adapta-\ntion of human communities to climate change, as \ndiscussed earlier (section 1). Policy makers remain \nlargely unaware of these different roles, which are not \nsufficiently considered in sustainable development \nand land-use planning policies. It is COMIFAC\u2019s \ntask to act as an ambassador, with support from \nOFAC and all conservation partners.\nTo be socially acceptable, efforts to combat \nclimate change must first be understood as neces-\nsary and useful for the development of countries \nand their inhabitants. This involves communicating \nto the general public, but also, in a more targeted \nmanner, to policy makers and private operators. \nThese efforts also must support the sustainable \ndevelopment of countries and contribute to poverty \nreduction (Eba\u2019a Atyi et al., 2015a and b; Reyniers \net al., 2016), including in landscapes where protected \nareas are located. \nIf fighting against climate change is to be effec-\ntive, this concern also must be integrated into \nsectoral policies and requires improvements in \nintersectoral institutional coordination (energy, \nmining, forestry, agriculture, environment, etc.; \nHeller & Zavaleta, 2009). This will require major \nchanges in \u00ad\ndecision-making and management \nmechanisms, often involving a complete break with \ncurrent practices."}

Some of these \nfactors, which relate to governance and to institutions \nand practices, also ultimately refer to the relationships \nof trust that are necessary between the parties, first of \nall between donors and recipients, but more broadly, \nbetween all stakeholders. Three factors playing a \nrole in the development of \u201cclimate\u201d financing and \nfinancing for protected areas may be highlighted here:\n\u2022\t 1.\u202fthe government must respect the views and \nactively support the participation of stakeholders \nin the project, giving them a full role in discussions, \ndecision-making and project implementation \n(stakeholders may be local communities, private \nactors, NGOs or associations; Reyniers et al., \n2016).

{"text":"386\n386\n4.2 Putting in place and operationalizing \na strategy to mobilize green finance \nfor\u00a0protected areas\nRelying on domestic financing to attract \nother investment\nProtected area networks are important both in \nsupporting sustainable national development and \nin contributing to strategies for populations to cope \nwith climate change.

It is \ntherefore appropriate that the international commu-\nnity contribute to their operations and effectiveness. \nUnder the aegis of COMIFAC, several countries \nin the subregion have begun a process of preparing \nnational strategies for the sustainable financing of \nprotected areas (see section 3.1).

{"text":"389\n389\nConclusions and prospects\nAfrican forests, mainly in Central Africa, store \nmore than one quarter of the carbon in the inter-\ntropical zone. Protected areas play a significant role \nin protecting these carbon stocks, regulating local \nand regional climates, and providing ecosystem \ngoods and services to human populations. Trans-\nboundary protected area complexes that have been \nset up in the subregion make it possible to protect \nvast areas in an ecological continuum capable of \nmaintaining viable forest ecosystems and plant and \nanimal populations.\nClimate change predictions indicate a trend \ntoward increasing global temperatures and a disrup-\ntion of other parameters (rainfall, winds, etc.) with an \nincreased frequency and intensity of extreme climate \nevents (droughts, flooding, etc.). These changes will \nhave negative impacts on protected areas in the region, \njeopardizing the many services which they provide \npeople, including in the fight against climate change. \nScientific studies undertaken to date in the \nsubregion on ecological processes and the impacts \nof climate change remain scattered and limited, \nalthough they already have confirmed the vulnera-\nbility of protected areas to these changes. Protected \nareas are particularly well suited for long-term \nmonitoring and analysis of ecological processes that \nare underlying and affected by climate change. This \nresearch should be not only diversified but multi-\ndisciplinary, collaborative and oriented toward \nunderstanding cause and effect relationships between \ndifferent taxonomic groups.\nGiven the role played by protected areas in \npreserving the world\u2019s climate for the benefit of \nhumanity, their protection and rational management \nshould be a global priority in the context of \u201cnature-\nbased solutions\u201d now advocated by the international \ncommunity.
