SOPA 2020, the volume you are now holding in your 
hands, completes and updates the inventory of the 
subregion’s protected area networks, but also breaks 
new ground by delving deeply into certain themes 
that were either only briefly discussed (governance, 
tourism, etc.) or not mentioned at all (human-­
elephant conflicts, mining and oil industry, etc.) in 
the first volume. These themes were discussed and 
approved in 2018 during a meeting of protected area 
specialists held in Douala.
The objective of SOPA 2020 is to contribute 
to a more effective use of approaches and tools for 
collecting and analysing data on protected area 
management in Central Africa. It aims to provide an 
overview of their importance with regard to global 
changes, but also to situate protected areas within 
national and regional territories. In keeping with the 
perspective of sustainable development in Central 
Africa, this geographical placement also must include 
the communities living in these territories. It is this 
much needed dual integration of protected areas that 
has guided the authors throughout the book.
This document is intended to be used by admin-
istrations in charge of protected areas, policy makers, 
technical and financial partners, research institutions, 
Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and anyone else 
interested in biodiversity conservation in Central 
Africa. Special emphasis is placed on up-to-date 
and harmonized data and analysis to inform policy 
makers and managers. It does not claim to be exhaus-
tive, and could not cover all relevant topics related to 
protected areas.

PREFACE
F. Palla, L. Itsoua-Madzous & C. Doumenge
Planning and managing protected areas require 
knowledge about the status of these areas and the 
issues affecting them. In 2015, the first edition of the 
State of Protected Areas in Central Africa (SOPA-
CA) provided an up-to-date assessment of national 
and subregional networks. This summary report 
was prepared by the Central African Forest Obser-
vatory (OFAC), under the auspices of the Central 
African Forests Commission (COMIFAC). The 
preparation of SOPA 2015 was funded by the Euro-
pean Union through the RIOFAC project and the 
­
BIOPAMA-IUCN program, the Network of Central 
African Protected Areas (RAPAC) through the 
OBAPAC project (Observatory of Biodiversity and 
Protected Areas of Central Africa), and the German 
Agency for International Cooperation through the 
GIZ COMIFAC support project.  Produced by a 
multinational group of Central African protected 
area experts, SOPA 2015 focused on presenting each 
country’s protected area network, both with regard to 
the types of protected areas as well as their size and 
distribution. This was complemented by summary 
analyses of various themes (legislation, institutions, 
governance, support projects, socio-economic issues). 
Following the success of SOPA 2015, many 
institutions voiced a desire to improve and rapidly 
update this publication. The momentum created by 
the production of the first edition led to the devel-
opment of the second, which explores in more detail 
various themes related to biodiversity conservation 
and protected area governance and management. 
SOPA 2020, the volume you are now holding in your 
hands, completes and updates the inventory of the 
subregion’s protected area networks, but also breaks 
new ground by delving deeply into certain themes 
that were either only briefly discussed (governance, 
tourism, etc.) or not mentioned at all (human-­
elephant conflicts, mining and oil industry, etc.) in 
the first volume.

a general overview of protected area governance 
(Chapter 2) which is complemented by a specific 
chapter (Chapter 3) on Public-Private Partnerships 
(PPP). The section’s final chapter (Chapter 4) intro-
duces the importance of information for decision 
making and management effectiveness, subjects that 
are too often neglected. The second section focuses 
on “Sustainable development and protected areas in 
Central Africa”. It offers insight into the conflicts 
undermining the sustainable development of Central 
African protected areas, and proposes possible solu-
tions. This section has five chapters that address issues 
considered important by specialists: human-elephant 
conflict (Chapter 5), transhumance and protected 
areas (Chapter 6), extractive industries and protected 
areas (Chapter 7), ecotourism (Chapter 8) and climate 
change (Chapter 9). To reach a wide audience, the 
book is being published in French and English.
The process of developing SOPA 2020 involved 
diverse actors from the North and South, repre-
senting OFAC, COMIFAC, government institutions 
in Central African countries, donors, the private 
sector, conservation NGOs, researchers and members 
of civil society. For this second edition, the process 
was launched in September 2018 and an Editorial 
Committee was set up and chaired by the Deputy 
Executive Secretary of COMIFAC. Workshops 
were held successively from May 2019 to November 
2020, both face-to-face and online, during which 
the members of the said committee defined and 
validated the content of the present document and 
the topics that were to be addressed, and then trans-
mitted instructions and guidelines to the prospective 
authors. These workshops also provided an oppor-
tunity to discuss the texts with their authors as the 
process moved along.
SOPA 2020 has been developed through a collab-
orative approach involving different stakeholders, 
including conservation experts, researchers and tech-
nical partners in the conservation field. Different 
authors volunteered to write the thematic chapters, 
with one or two lead authors coordinating the work 
of each group.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 43, 'topic': 'Conservation de la biodiversité en Afrique Centrale'}"

that of global biomass (total mass of all living organ-
isms) in 2020. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has 
not reached its peak, since projects predict that this 
anthropogenic mass will at the least double by 2040 
(Elhacham et al., 2020).
Nevertheless, biodiversity conservation and 
sustainable 
environmental 
management 
could 
increase resilience and reduce the vulnerability of 
human societies to climate change (de Wasseige 
et al., 2015; Seddon et al., 2019; see Chapter 9 of this 
book). In Africa, this change will be characterized by 
increasingly frequent droughts and increased vari-
ability in rainfall patterns (de Wasseige et al., 2015; 
IPBES, 2019). To check the loss of biodiversity, it 
is estimated that a minimum of 30% of the Earth’s 
surface must be protected through conservation 
measures, including 10% under strong protection 
(CDB, 2019; Hannah et al., 2020).
The expansion of protected area networks 
in Central Africa since the 20th century is an 
encouraging development. However, integrating 
environmental and biodiversity conservation issues 
into the emergence strategies of governments in 
the subregion will be challenging, particularly as 
the economic context is darkening. The decline in 
the price of oil per barrel since late 2018, coupled 
with the global health crisis stemming from Covid-
19, have led to a deteriorating economic situation. 
The subregion has not been spared from this global 
phenomenon as macroeconomic forecasts for 2020 
indicate a growth rate of between –2.5% and –4.3% 
(BAD, 2020). 
This situation is prompting governments to accel-
erate oil extraction and diversify national economies, 
especially toward mining and forestry industries. 
While some forestry industry actors are implementing 
more sustainable practices, this is not yet the case for 
many industrial actors (see Chapter 7). The devel-
opment of agribusiness also is being considered by 
decision-makers, generally to the detriment of diver-
sified agriculture.

Document 50: 18
Central Africa is a priority region for biodiversity conservation due to its exceptional 
heritage and high level of endemism (Colyn & Deleporte, 2004; Brooks et al., 2011; 
Dagalier et al., 2019). Its ecosystems have the value of a common good for both 
current generations, including the 40 million people who benefit from the natural 
resources they provide, and future ones (Nasi et al., 2011; Hiol Hiol et al., 2014; 
FAO, 2016). The social and cultural functions performed by these ecosystems are so 
essential that their alteration, let alone disappearance, would have consequences 
for the quality of life of populations at local, national and global levels.
As is the case in the rest of the world, biodiversity 
in the subregion is threatened, particularly through 
poaching (better organized and equipped), defor-
estation and the expansion of shifting agriculture, 
and so-called “development” activities (mining, urban 
expansion, etc.; Abernethy et al., 2016). This impact of 
anthropogenic activities on nature is unprecedented; 
the total mass of man-made materials (concrete, steel, 
asphalt, etc.) is increasing everywhere, and surpassed 
that of global biomass (total mass of all living organ-
isms) in 2020. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has 
not reached its peak, since projects predict that this 
anthropogenic mass will at the least double by 2040 
(Elhacham et al., 2020).
Nevertheless, biodiversity conservation and 
sustainable 
environmental 
management 
could 
increase resilience and reduce the vulnerability of 
human societies to climate change (de Wasseige 
et al., 2015; Seddon et al., 2019; see Chapter 9 of this 
book). In Africa, this change will be characterized by 
increasingly frequent droughts and increased vari-
ability in rainfall patterns (de Wasseige et al., 2015; 
IPBES, 2019).

Document 36: Central Africa for the most part 
escaped the massive fires that ravaged the Amazon, Southeast Asia and Australia in 2019-
2020, but this may not be the case in the future. The subregion has not been spared from 
global warming. Savannas and dry forests already have been weakened and attacked by fires, 
and pasturelands are no longer green, leaving animals hungry. Livestock farmers are forced to 
venture into protected areas for water and fresh grass for their herds. 
Ecosystems in the countries of Central Africa are becoming increasingly degraded due to 
intensifying anthropogenic pressures driven in particular by population growth and demand 
from international markets. Natural ecosystems are exposed to wildlife poaching, an expansion 
of transhumant pastoralism, an increase in mining permits, industrial agriculture and family 
farming, the exploitation of wood (timber, fuel wood), conflicts over land, and the list goes on.
In this constantly changing context, where international and local challenges are closely 
intertwined, protected areas are one of the most effective management tools for slowing 
biodiversity loss, mitigating the impact of climate change, and helping ecosystems and human 
communities adapt to change. Some countries have already understood this and have devel-
oped land-use plans that include national protected area networks capable of playing this 
triple ecological, social and economic role that is the backbone of sustainable development. 
State of Protected Areas in Central Africa 2020 illustrates the subregion’s contribution to safe-
guarding the quality of life of current and future generations. The book describes creative 
initiatives and approaches to biodiversity management. It calls for the meaningful participa-
tion of local communities and indigenous peoples in the management of protected areas. It 
suggests solutions facilitating the peaceful coexistence of humans and large wildlife. With a 
determination based on lessons learned, it suggests approaches and practices for the wise use 
of natural resources. 
This book aims to offer guidelines for discussion and action to support countries in the subre-
gion as they embark on the road to economic development. To be efficient and sustainable, 
this development must be based on a universal adherence to the principles of respect for the 
environment and social equity. It is the only way to prevent poverty and war.

many industrial actors (see Chapter 7). The devel-

decision-makers, generally to the detriment of diver-
sified agriculture. Yet agroecology and agroforestry 
could provide avenues for sustainable development, 
in contrast to conventional industrial approaches 
(Torquebiau, 2007; Meynard, 2017). 
National economies need to shift toward sustain-
able and environmentally-friendly sectors. This 
change of course will not be possible without the 
support of everyone involved, including foreigners 
(such as China), who are playing an increasingly 
important role in diverse key economic sectors.
The development of a greener economy should 
provide new opportunities for rural communities, 
which still rely heavily on subsistence slash-and-burn 
agriculture. This is the main driver of deforestation in 
Central Africa (Gillet et al., 2016; Karsenty, 2020), 
a deforestation which is likely to be exacerbated by 
the projected demographic growth. The subregion’s 
population, currently estimated at approximately 
185 million inhabitants (BAD, 2020), should more 
than double by 2050 (OFAC, n.d).
While changes in agricultural practices are 
indispensable, protected areas also can play an 
important role in this paradigm shift and contribute 
to the economic diversification of Central Africa. In 
addition to their fundamental role in ­
