Palla, L. Itsoua-Madzous & C. Doumenge\nPlanning and managing protected areas require \nknowledge about the status of these areas and the \nissues affecting them. In 2015, the first edition of the \nState of Protected Areas in Central Africa (SOPA-\nCA) provided an up-to-date assessment of national \nand subregional networks. This summary report \nwas prepared by the Central African Forest Obser-\nvatory (OFAC), under the auspices of the Central \nAfrican Forests Commission (COMIFAC). The \npreparation of SOPA 2015 was funded by the Euro-\npean Union through the RIOFAC project and the \n\u00ad\nBIOPAMA-IUCN program, the Network of Central \nAfrican Protected Areas (RAPAC) through the \nOBAPAC project (Observatory of Biodiversity and \nProtected Areas of Central Africa), and the German \nAgency for International Cooperation through the \nGIZ COMIFAC support project.\u00a0 Produced by a \nmultinational group of Central African protected \narea experts, SOPA 2015 focused on presenting each \ncountry\u2019s protected area network, both with regard to \nthe types of protected areas as well as their size and \ndistribution. This was complemented by summary \nanalyses of various themes (legislation, institutions, \ngovernance, support projects, socio-economic issues). \nFollowing the success of SOPA 2015, many \ninstitutions voiced a desire to improve and rapidly \nupdate this publication. The momentum created by \nthe production of the first edition led to the devel-\nopment of the second, which explores in more detail \nvarious themes related to biodiversity conservation \nand protected area governance and management. \nSOPA 2020, the volume you are now holding in your \nhands, completes and updates the inventory of the \nsubregion\u2019s protected area networks, but also breaks \nnew ground by delving deeply into certain themes \nthat were either only briefly discussed (governance, \ntourism, etc.) or not mentioned at all (human-\u00ad\nelephant conflicts, mining and oil industry, etc.) in \nthe first volume.\n\nDocument 45: 15\na general overview of protected area governance \n(Chapter\u202f2) which is complemented by a specific \nchapter (Chapter\u202f3) on Public-Private Partnerships \n(PPP). The section\u2019s final chapter (Chapter\u202f4) intro-\nduces the importance of information for decision \nmaking and management effectiveness, subjects that \nare too often neglected. The second section focuses \non \u201cSustainable development and protected areas in \nCentral Africa\u201d. It offers insight into the conflicts \nundermining the sustainable development of Central \nAfrican protected areas, and proposes possible solu-\ntions. This section has five chapters that address issues \nconsidered important by specialists: human-elephant \nconflict (Chapter\u202f5), transhumance and protected \nareas (Chapter\u202f6), extractive industries and protected \nareas (Chapter\u202f7), ecotourism (Chapter\u202f8) and climate \nchange (Chapter\u202f9). To reach a wide audience, the \nbook is being published in French and English.\nThe process of developing SOPA 2020 involved \ndiverse actors from the North and South, repre-\nsenting OFAC, COMIFAC, government institutions \nin Central African countries, donors, the private \nsector, conservation NGOs, researchers and members \nof civil society. For this second edition, the process \nwas launched in September 2018 and an Editorial \nCommittee was set up and chaired by the Deputy \nExecutive Secretary of COMIFAC. Workshops \nwere held successively from May 2019 to November \n2020, both face-to-face and online, during which \nthe members of the said committee defined and \nvalidated the content of the present document and \nthe topics that were to be addressed, and then trans-\nmitted instructions and guidelines to the prospective \nauthors. These workshops also provided an oppor-\ntunity to discuss the texts with their authors as the \nprocess moved along.\nSOPA 2020 has been developed through a collab-\norative approach involving different stakeholders, \nincluding conservation experts, researchers and tech-\nnical partners in the conservation field. Different \nauthors volunteered to write the thematic chapters, \nwith one or two lead authors coordinating the work \nof each group.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":43,"topic":"Conservation de la biodiversit\u00e9 en Afrique Centrale"}}

Unfortunately, this phenomenon has \nnot reached its peak, since projects predict that this \nanthropogenic mass will at the least double by 2040 \n(Elhacham et al., 2020).\nNevertheless, biodiversity conservation and \nsustainable \nenvironmental \nmanagement \ncould \nincrease resilience and reduce the vulnerability of \nhuman societies to climate change (de Wasseige \net al., 2015; Seddon et al., 2019; see Chapter\u202f9 of this \nbook). In Africa, this change will be characterized by \nincreasingly frequent droughts and increased vari-\nability in rainfall patterns (de Wasseige et al., 2015; \nIPBES, 2019). To check the loss of biodiversity, it \nis estimated that a minimum of 30% of the Earth\u2019s \nsurface must be protected through conservation \nmeasures, including 10% under strong protection \n(CDB, 2019; Hannah et al., 2020).\nThe expansion of protected area networks \nin Central Africa since the 20th century is an \nencouraging development. However, integrating \nenvironmental and biodiversity conservation issues \ninto the emergence strategies of governments in \nthe subregion will be challenging, particularly as \nthe economic context is darkening. The decline in \nthe price of oil per barrel since late 2018, coupled \nwith the global health crisis stemming from Covid-\n19, have led to a deteriorating economic situation. \nThe subregion has not been spared from this global \nphenomenon as macroeconomic forecasts for 2020 \nindicate a growth rate of between \u20132.5% and \u20134.3% \n(BAD, 2020). \nThis situation is prompting governments to accel-\nerate oil extraction and diversify national economies, \nespecially toward mining and forestry industries. \nWhile some forestry industry actors are implementing \nmore sustainable practices, this is not yet the case for \nmany industrial actors (see Chapter\u202f7). The devel-\nopment of agribusiness also is being considered by \ndecision-makers, generally to the detriment of diver-\nsified agriculture.\n\nDocument 50: 18\nCentral Africa is a priority region for biodiversity conservation due to its exceptional \nheritage and high level of endemism (Colyn & Deleporte, 2004; Brooks et al., 2011; \nDagalier et al., 2019). Its ecosystems have the value of a common good for both \ncurrent generations, including the 40\u202fmillion people who benefit from the natural \nresources they provide, and future ones (Nasi et al., 2011; Hiol Hiol et al., 2014; \nFAO,\u00a02016). The social and cultural functions performed by these ecosystems are so \nessential that their alteration, let alone disappearance, would have consequences \nfor the quality of life of populations at local, national and global levels.\nAs is the case in the rest of the world, biodiversity \nin the subregion is threatened, particularly through \npoaching (better organized and equipped), defor-\nestation and the expansion of shifting agriculture, \nand so-called \u201cdevelopment\u201d activities (mining, urban \nexpansion, etc.; Abernethy et al., 2016).\u00a0This impact of \nanthropogenic activities on nature is unprecedented; \nthe total mass of man-made materials (concrete, steel, \nasphalt, etc.) is increasing everywhere, and surpassed \nthat of global biomass (total mass of all living organ-\nisms) in 2020. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has \nnot reached its peak, since projects predict that this \nanthropogenic mass will at the least double by 2040 \n(Elhacham et al., 2020).\nNevertheless, biodiversity conservation and \nsustainable \nenvironmental \nmanagement \ncould \nincrease resilience and reduce the vulnerability of \nhuman societies to climate change (de Wasseige \net al., 2015; Seddon et al., 2019; see Chapter\u202f9 of this \nbook). In Africa, this change will be characterized by \nincreasingly frequent droughts and increased vari-\nability in rainfall patterns (de Wasseige et al., 2015; \nIPBES, 2019).\n\nDocument 36: Central Africa for the most part \nescaped the massive fires that ravaged the Amazon, Southeast Asia and Australia in 2019-\n2020, but this may not be the case in the future. The subregion has not been spared from \nglobal warming. Savannas and dry forests already have been weakened and attacked by fires, \nand pasturelands are no longer green, leaving animals hungry. Livestock farmers are forced to \nventure into protected areas for water and fresh grass for their herds. \nEcosystems in the countries of Central Africa are becoming increasingly degraded due to \nintensifying anthropogenic pressures driven in particular by population growth and demand \nfrom international markets. Natural ecosystems are exposed to wildlife poaching, an expansion \nof transhumant pastoralism, an increase in mining permits, industrial agriculture and family \nfarming, the exploitation of wood (timber, fuel wood), conflicts over land, and the list goes on.\nIn this constantly changing context, where international and local challenges are closely \nintertwined, protected areas are one of the most effective management tools for slowing \nbiodiversity loss, mitigating the impact of climate change, and helping ecosystems and human \ncommunities adapt to change. Some countries have already understood this and have devel-\noped land-use plans that include national protected area networks capable of playing this \ntriple ecological, social and economic role that is the backbone of sustainable development. \nState of Protected Areas in Central Africa 2020 illustrates the subregion\u2019s contribution to safe-\nguarding the quality of life of current and future generations. The book describes creative \ninitiatives and approaches to biodiversity management. It calls for the meaningful participa-\ntion of local communities and indigenous peoples in the management of protected areas. It \nsuggests solutions facilitating the peaceful coexistence of humans and large wildlife. With a \ndetermination based on lessons learned, it suggests approaches and practices for the wise use \nof natural resources. \nThis book aims to offer guidelines for discussion and action to support countries in the subre-\ngion as they embark on the road to economic development. To be efficient and sustainable, \nthis development must be based on a universal adherence to the principles of respect for the \nenvironment and social equity. It is the only way to prevent poverty and war.\n\nDocument 52: The decline in \nthe price of oil per barrel since late 2018, coupled \nwith the global health crisis stemming from Covid-\n19, have led to a deteriorating economic situation. \nThe subregion has not been spared from this global \nphenomenon as macroeconomic forecasts for 2020 \nindicate a growth rate of between \u20132.5% and \u20134.3% \n(BAD, 2020). \nThis situation is prompting governments to accel-\nerate oil extraction and diversify national economies, \nespecially toward mining and forestry industries. \nWhile some forestry industry actors are implementing \nmore sustainable practices, this is not yet the case for \nmany industrial actors (see Chapter\u202f7).

Yet agroecology and agroforestry \ncould provide avenues for sustainable development, \nin contrast to conventional industrial approaches \n(Torquebiau, 2007; Meynard, 2017). \nNational economies need to shift toward sustain-\nable and environmentally-friendly sectors. This \nchange of course will not be possible without the \nsupport of everyone involved, including foreigners \n(such as China), who are playing an increasingly \nimportant role in diverse key economic sectors.\nThe development of a greener economy should \nprovide new opportunities for rural communities, \nwhich still rely heavily on subsistence slash-and-burn \nagriculture.
