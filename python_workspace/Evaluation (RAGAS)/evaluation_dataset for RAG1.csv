""What is the role of sustainable management and certification of forestry concessions in maintaining forest biodiversity and associated ecosystem services?""

This question is formed using the keyphrase ""Sustainable management of forestry concessions"" and can be fully answered by referencing the context provided.","['36\n2016 in Ndjambou et al., 2019). It is also in these \nwaters that nearly 10% of the world’s humpback \nwhales (Megaptera novaengliae) come to breed, which \nrecently has become the focus of tourism activities. \nIn 1981, the Convention for Cooperation in the \nProtection and Development of the Marine Envi -\nronment and Coastal Environment of the Western, \nCentral and Southern African Region (or Abidjan \nConvention) was adopted. Article 11 of this convention \nprovides for the creation of “specially protected areas”. \nThe network of Central African marine protected areas \nhas only been substantially deployed since 2017, mainly \nin Gabonese territorial waters. However, the marine \necosystems which are currently protected do not repre -\nsent their diversity; Gabon having the only marine \nprotected area on the high seas (UICN, 2015b). \nThe development of a network of marine protected \nareas, designed on coherent geographical scales from \nthe point of view of ecosystems, and benefiting from \nsufficient human and material financial resources for \ntheir proper functioning, is therefore an important \nlever for the conservation of the marine and coastal \nwealth of Central Africa. The Blue Gabon program \naims to strengthen the protection of the marine \nenvironment with the establishment of 20 marine \nprotected areas, representing 26% of the national \nterritorial waters (National Geographic, 2017). This \ninitiative should encourage other coastal countries \nin the subregion to contribute more effectively to \nthe protection of marine environments and species, \nwithin the framework of the strategic work program \non marine protected areas (UICN, n.d.).\n2.3. Protected areas  \nand ecological networks\nEffective protection of biodiversity requires \nrespect for the biology and needs of its constituent \nspecies. Certain species, such as savanna (L. africana) \nand forest elephants, require vast territories to survive. \nThe main task is to allow the natural movements of \npopulations (migrations, access to food sources...) but \nalso genetic mixing, which is essential for the main-\ntenance and adaptation of animal and plant species \n(Triplet et al., 2020).\nThe effectiveness of each protected area must \nbe considered on the scale of larger ecological networks, including other protected areas, but also \nother territories allowing a continuity of natural \nor semi-natural ecosystems within this territorial \nmesh (Funwi-Gabga et al., 2014). Other areas, such \nas ZICs (see box section 1.3) and managed and \ncertified forestry concessions, can contribute to this \nconnectivity and to the protection of animal and \nplant species (Figure 9). Indeed, these economic \nactivities require healthy environments in order \nto maintain populations of desired species – both \nanimal and plant – and thus, indirectly, their habitats. \nThe ZICs of the savannas of Cameroon and CAR, \nand the other protected areas of these two coun -\ntries and of Chad, thus make it possible to create \nvast, functional ecological complexes in the savanna \nzones. The ZICs in southern Cameroon also could \nstrengthen connectivity between the national parks \nin the Sangha Trinational complex, which straddles \nthe borders of Cameroon, Congo and Gabon.\nForestry concessions account for 36% of the total \narea of great ape priority conservation zones and \n14% of the forest elephant’s range. These concessions, \nwhen under sustainable management and certifica-\ntion, also allow the maintenance of a forest framework \nthat is vital for the maintenance of forest biodiversity \nand associated ecosystem services (Van Vliet et al., \n2017; Lhoest et al., 2020). Wildlife erosion in these \nconcessions is indeed less significant than in forestry \nconcessions without management plans (Karsenty & \nGourlet-Fleury, 2016).\nEffective conservation policies therefore need to \ntake into account the multiplicity of land uses, partic-\nularly the areas inhabited by species that are subject \nto conservation or sustainable management measures, \nboth within and outside protected areas (Morgan & \nSanz, 2007). This means developing multi- sectoral \nland-use plans, including, in particular, the use of \nwood, hunting, agriculture and the mining and \noil industries with conservation activities (see also \nChapter 7).

COMIFAC is one of the world’s largest \nnetworks working to protect biodiversity and combat climate change. This book helps to \nsound the alarm about the risks and dangers facing the planet, but also covers numerous initi-\natives essential for the well-being of people within their environment.\nCentral Africa is a land of diversity, one marked by diverse climates, soils, landscapes, ecosys-\ntems, fauna and flora. The home of the Congo Basin, Central Africa also is a land of extremes. \nNot only is the Congo Basin the second largest continuous tropical forest track in the world, it \nalso is the site of the world’s largest complex of swamp forests and peat bogs. But this land, \none which has nurtured generations of Africans, is facing mounting pressures.\nWorldwide, 2019 was the second hottest year on record, just 0.04 °C cooler than 2016. More-\nover, the decade 2010-2019 was the warmest ever recorded. Central Africa for the most part \nescaped the massive fires that ravaged the Amazon, Southeast Asia and Australia in 2019-\n2020, but this may not be the case in the future. The subregion has not been spared from \nglobal warming. Savannas and dry forests already have been weakened and attacked by fires, \nand pasturelands are no longer green, leaving animals hungry. Livestock farmers are forced to \nventure into protected areas for water and fresh grass for their herds. \nEcosystems in the countries of Central Africa are becoming increasingly degraded due to \nintensifying anthropogenic pressures driven in particular by population growth and demand \nfrom international markets. Natural ecosystems are exposed to wildlife poaching, an expansion \nof transhumant pastoralism, an increase in mining permits, industrial agriculture and family \nfarming, the exploitation of wood (timber, fuel wood), conflicts over land, and the list goes on.\nIn this constantly changing context, where international and local challenges are closely \nintertwined, protected areas are one of the most effective management tools for slowing \nbiodiversity loss, mitigating the impact of climate change, and helping ecosystems and human \ncommunities adapt to change. Some countries have already understood this and have devel-\noped land-use plans that include national protected area networks capable of playing this \ntriple ecological, social and economic role that is the backbone of sustainable development. \nState of Protected Areas in Central Africa 2020 illustrates the subregion’s contribution to safe-\nguarding the quality of life of current and future generations. The book describes creative \ninitiatives and approaches to biodiversity management. It calls for the meaningful participa-\ntion of local communities and indigenous peoples in the management of protected areas. It \nsuggests solutions facilitating the peaceful coexistence of humans and large wildlife. With a \ndetermination based on lessons learned, it suggests approaches and practices for the wise use \nof natural resources. \nThis book aims to offer guidelines for discussion and action to support countries in the subre-\ngion as they embark on the road to economic development. To be efficient and sustainable, \nthis development must be based on a universal adherence to the principles of respect for the \nenvironment and social equity. It is the only way to prevent poverty and war.\nThe opportunistic granting of industrial resource exploitation permits on locations known to \nbe part of protected areas is undermining the fulfilment of national and international commit-\nments regarding biodiversity conservation. The construction of major infrastructure without \nprior environmental and social impact studies can no longer be accepted. A proliferation of \narmed gangs, poor treatment of eco-guards, illegal activities of a few local residents and ', '11\nendemic poverty is contributing to wildlife crime through poaching, which is nonetheless \npreventable.

Some countries, such as Gabon, have tackled \nthis problem head-on, with the support of non- \ngovernmental organizations such as Conservation \nJustice (2021). The low level of justiciability (RADE, \n2020) is attributable to the lack of monitoring and \ncontrol bodies and, above all, of judicial bodies with \njurisdiction over wildlife crime and related issues. \nOne solution would be to rely on “legal indicators” \nof the effectiveness of national and regional wildlife \nmanagement legislation. \nAs some texts are difficult to apply, the contri-\nbution of scientific data and information to the \ndevelopment of legal texts in the biodiversity sector \nshould be strengthened. This is a major challenge \nfor the next few years, for genuine applicability and \nespecially for the importance of environmental juris-\ndiction. The aim is to strengthen the development \nof environmental law and its effectiveness at both \nnational and regional levels (RADE, 2020).\nOnly five member countries of the Central African \nForest Commission (COMIFAC) have ratified the \nrevised Maputo Convention on the Conservation of \nNature and Natural Resources, which entered into \nforce on 23 July 2016. This Convention provides, alongside obligations to protect natural habitats, their \nfauna and flora, actions relating to the preservation \nand restoration of these natural habitats. Protected \nareas are thus particularly concerned.\nThe subregional agreement on forest control \nin Central Africa, signed in 2008, is not limited to \nlogging; it commits member States to strengthening \nsubregional cooperation for the protection of wildlife, \nincluding the fight against poaching. Above all, it is \nan incentive for the signatory States to share strate-\ngies and operational means to fight poaching in the \ncontext of transboundary protected areas. However, \nthe implementation of this important agreement \nis still in its infancy. Subregional capacity-building \nworkshops for wildlife law enforcement officers (with \nrepresentatives from the judiciary, forestry, customs \nand police) should improve the situation.\nFurthermore, the revised Treaty establishing the \nEconomic Community of Central African States \n(CEEAC), which came into force in 2020, commits \nStates to greater cooperation in the areas of the envi-\nronment, natural resources and biodiversity than was \nthe case under the 1983 Treaty. However, even though \norganized wildlife crime is increasing in the subre-\ngion, there is still no regional unification of legislation \non wildlife and protected areas, as the priorities of \nCEEAC member States end with the harmonization \nof national policies.\n']",,multi_context,"[{'source': '../../pdf/EdAP 2020_EN.pdf', 'page': 11, 'filename': '../../pdf/EdAP 2020_EN.pdf'}, {'source': '../../pdf/EdAP 2020_EN.pdf', 'page': 12, 'filename': '../../pdf/EdAP 2020_EN.pdf'}, {'source': '../../pdf/EdAP 2020_EN.pdf', 'page': 40, 'filename': '../../pdf/EdAP 2020_EN.pdf'}]",True,"I don't know, thanks for asking!"

"Here is the generated question:

""What are the main threats to the conservation of great apes in Central Africa?""

This question can be fully answered from the given context, which discusses the decline of great ape populations due to habitat loss, disease, hunting, and the pet trade, as well as the importance of protected areas and conservation initiatives.","['34\nStatus of the great apes in Central Africa\nE. Abwe, San Diego Zoo Global & WCS\nPopulations of all great apes have declined in recent decades (Table 6), mainly due to habitat \nloss and fragmentation (Tyukavina et al., 2018), disease (i.e., Ebola; Walsh et al., 2003), hunting \nand the bushmeat trade (Williamson, 2018), but also the pet trade, which can result in the death \nof adults at the time of capture. The situation is such that all great apes are listed in Appendix 1 \nof the IUCN Red List (Ancrenaz et al., 2018).\nThe conservation issues surrounding these animals are critical and many measures have been \ntaken to stop this dynamic. Internationally, governments have ratified the Agreement for the \nConservation of Gorillas and their Habitats (Gorilla Agreement), which came into force in 2008. \nOutside of government initiatives, protection programs also have been created, overseen by \ninternational organizations such as IUCN (e.g., the Bonobo Conservation Strategy 2012-2022).\nProtected areas are an important tool for the protection of great apes, where they are subject \nto enhanced protection. In particular, the presence of eco-guards on the ground is an effec -\ntive measure to deter and control poaching activities (UICN, 2014). Awareness-raising actions \nimplemented in certain protected areas are also fundamental, such as those initiated in the \nLossi sanctuary (Congo), along with an experiment in habituating gorillas to humans (see box in \nChapter 2). They sometimes lead to the creation of local associations, as is the case in the Ebo \nforest in Cameroon, with the Club des amis des gorilles, or in DRC, with the Groupe d’appui pour \nla conservation des écosystèmes de Basanku et Bolomba.\nDespite all of these initiatives, the protection of great apes in Central Africa remains a major \nissue. In addition to all of the threats mentioned above, there also are problems associated with \narmed conflicts, economic opportunities for local communities, etc. The role of protected areas \ncan be improved through a number of means, including better law enforcement (UICN, 2014) \nand the creation of buffer zones around protected areas, especially where they are surrounded \nby “a mosaic of forest types, habitats and areas used by humans” (Morgan & Sanz, 2007).\n']","The main threats to the conservation of great apes in Central Africa are habitat loss and fragmentation, disease (specifically Ebola), hunting and the bushmeat trade, and the pet trade. Additionally, armed conflicts and economic opportunities for local communities also pose a challenge to the protection of great apes in Central Africa.",simple,"[{'source': '../../pdf/EdAP 2020_EN.pdf', 'page': 35, 'filename': '../../pdf/EdAP 2020_EN.pdf'}]",True,"The main threats to the conservation of great apes in Central Africa include habitat loss and fragmentation, disease such as Ebola, hunting and the bushmeat trade, and the pet trade.
